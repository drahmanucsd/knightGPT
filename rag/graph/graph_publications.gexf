OmniCellTOSG: The First Cell&#10;Text-Omic Signaling Graphs Dataset for Joint LLM and GNN Modeling. In&#10;Proceedings of Proceedings of the 31th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge&#10;Discovery and Data Mining (KDD’ 25). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 11 pages.&#10;https://doi.org/XXXXXXXXX&#10;Copy&#10;1&#10;Introduction&#10;The human body consists of approximately 37.2 trillion cells, all&#10;originating from a single embryonic cell and sharing the same copy&#10;of genome. The complex, robust and accurate cell signaling systems,&#10;regulated by varying abundance of proteins and their interactions,&#10;create diverse cell types with different functions at different or-&#10;gans. The cell signaling systems are evolved and altered by many&#10;factors, like age, sex, diet, environment exposures and diseases.&#10;Though many biomarkers and knowledge have been uncovered in&#10;life science and healthcare studies, the cell signaling systems still&#10;remain mysterious. For example, what are the panoramic view of&#10;cell signaling systems (all the entities and their interactions) within&#10;the cells? How do the cell signaling systems evolve and altered by&#10;the factors, like age, sex and diseases? What are the disease related&#10;cell subtypes and the interactions among these cells? How can we&#10;perturb these cells’ signaling systems and interactions to prevent&#10;and treat diseases. These questions (e.g., disease pathogenesis) are&#10;some of the major reasons of why there is no drug can cure com-&#10;plex diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cancer, heart disease,&#10;and many other chronic inflammation related diseases, like kidney&#10;failure and liver hepatitis and cirrhosis.&#10;Recently, single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNAseq) has&#10;revolutionized our ability to measure transcriptomic abundance at&#10;individual cell level. With the sc/snRNAseq, it is feasible to identify&#10;the cell types/subtypes in (disease) tissues, and investigate the cell&#10;signaling systems and their signaling interactions within a niche&#10;or microenvironment (ME). For example, hundreds of millions of&#10;sc/snRNAseq data were generated by Human Cell Atlas (HCA)[24],&#10;Brain Cell Atlas[4], and many studies of diverse diseases[18, 20].&#10;These datasets are valuable to systematically investigate and decode&#10;the cell signaling systems. In another word, it is crucial to under-&#10;stand which groups of genes/proteins with different abundance&#10;levels work together coordinately to achieve the specific biological&#10;1https://github.com/FuhaiLiAiLab/OmniCellTOSG&#10;functions or tasks in the diverse cell sub-populations in a disease&#10;or organ niche.&#10;Furthermore, the success of large-scale foundation models, like&#10;chatGPT, have revolutionized AI research and applications. The&#10;foundation models were pretrained on massive and diverse datasets&#10;via self-supervised learning (SSL), and thus can have the general-&#10;ized understanding of the information patterns embedded within&#10;the massive and diverse training data, consequently, serving as a&#10;solid base upon which specialized adaptations can be developed&#10;to tackle specific tasks or challenges. Therefore, the disease spe-&#10;cific data analysis only measures and observes a limited of number&#10;of cell signaling systems patterns/scenarios. Consequently, deep&#10;learning models trained on small-scale, disease-specific datasets are&#10;prone to bias and overfitting, often converging to local minima. This&#10;challenge is analogous to the limitations of training ChatGPT-scale&#10;foundation models on restricted language datasets. Thus, foun-&#10;dation models have emerged as a promising approach to address&#10;these issues. However, due to their inherent &quot;black box&quot; nature, most&#10;foundation models struggle to effectively integrate detailed biolog-&#10;ical information pertaining to cell signaling interactions. Herein,&#10;in this study, we build the OmniCellTOSG dataset. To the best&#10;of our knowledge, OmniCellTOSG is the first Text-Omic Signal-&#10;ing Graph (TOSG) dataset. It creates a new graph data type inte-&#10;grating both human-understandable text-attributed information&#10;and numerical omic features. The textual information annotates&#10;the accumulated knowledge of genes or proteins, like the biolog-&#10;ical functions, cellular locations, related diseases and drugs. The&#10;omic feature indicates the abundance level of the genes/proteins.&#10;In its current version, the human-interpretable annotations are de-&#10;rived from BioMedGraphica[34], a unified database compiling prior&#10;knowledge on genes, proteins, drugs, diseases, and phenotypes from&#10;diverse data sources. Future iterations will incorporate enriched&#10;knowledge from extensive literature, synthesized using advanced&#10;large language models such as ChatGPT-4. This unprecedented&#10;dataset is expected to facilitate the development of novel joint foun-&#10;dation models that integrate large language models (LLMs) with&#10;graph neural networks (GNNs) to decode complex cell signaling&#10;networks for interesting cell signaling patterns.&#10;In the following sections, we detailed the construction and uti-&#10;lization of OmniCellTOSG, including data sourcing, preprocessing&#10;workflows, graph-generation protocols, and data loading using&#10;our developed package, CellTOSGDataset. By releasing OmniCell-&#10;TOSG to the broader research community, we aim to foster col-&#10;laboration between data scientists and biologists, ultimately accel-&#10;erating breakthroughs in precision medicine and enhancing our&#10;understanding of disease pathogenesis.&#10;2&#10;Related Work&#10;Recently, massive single cell/nuelcus RNASeq datasets have been&#10;generated to study the diversity of cellular transcriptomics, e.g.,&#10;the human cell atlas (HCA) project, CZ CellxGene Database, Allen&#10;Brain Cell Atlas, and massive datasets in AD knowledge portal, like&#10;SEA-AD and many AD studies, as well as many other diseases6,&#10;and datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In addition, a&#10;few exploratory foundation models (only using the gene expression&#10;value in random orders), have been developed based on the massive" />
