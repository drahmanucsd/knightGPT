They soon know that they will grow&#10;up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old&#10;she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran&#10;with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather&#10;delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh,&#10;why can’t you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed&#10;between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must&#10;grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the&#10;end.&#10;&#10;Of course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the&#10;chief one. She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet&#10;mocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within&#10;the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover&#10;there is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on&#10;it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly&#10;conspicuous in the right-hand corner.&#10;&#10;The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been&#10;boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,&#10;and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who&#10;took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her,&#10;except the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and&#10;in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could&#10;have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a&#10;passion, slamming the door.&#10;&#10;Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him&#10;but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks&#10;and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know,&#10;and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that&#10;would have made any woman respect him.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books&#10;perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a&#10;Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped&#10;out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.&#10;She drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs.&#10;Darling’s guesses.&#10;&#10;Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.&#10;&#10;For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would&#10;be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was&#10;frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the&#10;edge of Mrs. Darling’s bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses,&#10;while she looked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what&#10;might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece&#10;of paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at&#10;the beginning again.&#10;&#10;“Now don’t interrupt,” he would beg of her.&#10;&#10;“I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can&#10;cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and&#10;six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five&#10;naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven—who is that&#10;moving?—eight nine seven, dot and carry seven—don’t speak, my own—and&#10;the pound you lent to that man who came to the door—quiet, child—dot&#10;and carry child—there, you’ve done it!—did I say nine nine seven? yes,&#10;I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on&#10;nine nine seven?”&#10;&#10;“Of course we can, George,” she cried. But she was prejudiced in&#10;Wendy’s favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.&#10;&#10;“Remember mumps,” he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went&#10;again. “Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay it&#10;will be more like thirty shillings—don’t speak—measles one five, German&#10;measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six—don’t waggle your&#10;finger—whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings”—and so on it went, and it&#10;added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through,&#10;with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated&#10;as one.&#10;&#10;There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a&#10;narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the&#10;three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom’s Kindergarten school,&#10;accompanied by their nurse.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a&#10;passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had&#10;a nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children&#10;drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had&#10;belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She&#10;had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had&#10;become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most&#10;of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by&#10;careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of&#10;to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How&#10;thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one&#10;of her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the&#10;nursery. She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have&#10;no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She&#10;believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf,&#10;and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs,&#10;and so on. It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the&#10;children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well&#10;behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. On John’s&#10;footer days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried&#10;an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the&#10;basement of Miss Fulsom’s school where the nurses wait. They sat on&#10;forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference.&#10;They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to&#10;themselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to&#10;the nursery from Mrs. Darling’s friends, but if they did come she first&#10;whipped off Michael’s pinafore and put him into the one with blue&#10;braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John’s hair.&#10;&#10;No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr.&#10;Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the&#10;neighbours talked.&#10;&#10;He had his position in the city to consider.&#10;&#10;Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that&#10;she did not admire him. “I know she admires you tremendously, George,”&#10;Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children&#10;to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the&#10;only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget&#10;she looked in her long skirt and maid’s cap, though she had sworn, when&#10;engaged, that she would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps!&#10;And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that&#10;all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at&#10;her you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family&#10;until the coming of Peter Pan.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her&#10;children’s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after&#10;her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things&#10;straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many&#10;articles that have wandered during the day. If you could keep awake&#10;(but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and&#10;you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like&#10;tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering&#10;humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had&#10;picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet,&#10;pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and&#10;hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the&#10;naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been&#10;folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top,&#10;beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you&#10;to put on.&#10;&#10;I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind.&#10;Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can&#10;become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a&#10;child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the&#10;time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a&#10;card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is&#10;always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here&#10;and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and&#10;savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves&#10;through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a&#10;hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked&#10;nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first&#10;day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,&#10;hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting&#10;into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth&#10;yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they&#10;are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing,&#10;especially as nothing will stand still.&#10;&#10;Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a&#10;lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while&#10;Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over&#10;it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a&#10;wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no&#10;friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by&#10;its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance,&#10;and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have&#10;each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play&#10;are for ever beaching their coracles. We too have been there; we can&#10;still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.&#10;&#10;Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most&#10;compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances&#10;between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at&#10;it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least&#10;alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very&#10;real. That is why there are night-lights.&#10;&#10;Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling&#10;found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most&#10;perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was&#10;here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be&#10;scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than&#10;any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had&#10;an oddly cocky appearance.&#10;&#10;“Yes, he is rather cocky,” Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother had&#10;been questioning her.&#10;&#10;“But who is he, my pet?”&#10;&#10;“He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.”&#10;&#10;At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her&#10;childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the&#10;fairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died&#10;he went part of the way with them, so that they should not be&#10;frightened. She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was&#10;married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such&#10;person.&#10;&#10;“Besides,” she said to Wendy, “he would be grown up by this time.”&#10;&#10;“Oh no, he isn’t grown up,” Wendy assured her confidently, “and he is&#10;just my size.” She meant that he was her size in both mind and body;&#10;she didn’t know how she knew, she just knew it.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. “Mark my&#10;words,” he said, “it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their&#10;heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it&#10;will blow over.”&#10;&#10;But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs.&#10;Darling quite a shock.&#10;&#10;Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.&#10;For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event&#10;happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead&#10;father and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy&#10;one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had&#10;been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when&#10;the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when&#10;Wendy said with a tolerant smile:&#10;&#10;“I do believe it is that Peter again!”&#10;&#10;“Whatever do you mean, Wendy?”&#10;&#10;“It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said, sighing.&#10;She was a tidy child.&#10;&#10;She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter&#10;sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her&#10;bed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so&#10;she didn’t know how she knew, she just knew.&#10;&#10;“What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house&#10;without knocking.”&#10;&#10;“I think he comes in by the window,” she said.&#10;&#10;“My love, it is three floors up.”&#10;&#10;“Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?”&#10;&#10;It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural&#10;to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.&#10;&#10;“My child,” the mother cried, “why did you not tell me of this before?”&#10;&#10;“I forgot,” said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her&#10;breakfast.&#10;&#10;Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.&#10;&#10;But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined&#10;them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they&#10;did not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the&#10;floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She&#10;rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. She let down a&#10;tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty&#10;feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.&#10;&#10;Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.&#10;&#10;But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the&#10;night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be&#10;said to have begun.&#10;&#10;On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It&#10;happened to be Nana’s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and&#10;sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away&#10;into the land of sleep.&#10;&#10;All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and&#10;sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.&#10;&#10;It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into&#10;shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three&#10;night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling’s lap. Then&#10;her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of&#10;them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the&#10;fire. There should have been a fourth night-light.&#10;&#10;While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come&#10;too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not&#10;alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many&#10;women who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of&#10;some mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures&#10;the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through&#10;the gap.&#10;&#10;The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was&#10;dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the&#10;floor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist,&#10;which darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must&#10;have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.&#10;&#10;She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at&#10;once that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we&#10;should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling’s kiss. He was a&#10;lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of&#10;trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his&#10;first teeth. When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little&#10;pearls at her.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter II.&#10;THE SHADOW&#10;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened,&#10;and Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang&#10;at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling&#10;screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed,&#10;and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it&#10;was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see&#10;nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.&#10;&#10;She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her&#10;mouth, which proved to be the boy’s shadow. As he leapt at the window&#10;Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had&#10;not had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.&#10;&#10;You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was&#10;quite the ordinary kind.&#10;&#10;Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow.&#10;She hung it out at the window, meaning “He is sure to come back for it;&#10;let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the&#10;children.”&#10;&#10;But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the&#10;window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the&#10;house. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up&#10;winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his&#10;head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him;&#10;besides, she knew exactly what he would say: “It all comes of having a&#10;dog for a nurse.”&#10;&#10;She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a&#10;drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah&#10;me!&#10;&#10;The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten&#10;Friday. Of course it was a Friday.&#10;&#10;“I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,” she used to say&#10;afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of&#10;her, holding her hand.&#10;&#10;“No, no,” Mr. Darling always said, “I am responsible for it all. I,&#10;George Darling, did it. _Mea culpa, mea culpa_.” He had had a classical&#10;education.&#10;&#10;They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every&#10;detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other&#10;side like the faces on a bad coinage.&#10;&#10;“If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,” Mrs.&#10;Darling said.&#10;&#10;“If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana’s bowl,” said Mr.&#10;Darling.&#10;&#10;“If only I had pretended to like the medicine,” was what Nana’s wet&#10;eyes said.&#10;&#10;“My liking for parties, George.”&#10;&#10;“My fatal gift of humour, dearest.”&#10;&#10;“My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.”&#10;&#10;Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the&#10;thought, “It’s true, it’s true, they ought not to have had a dog for a&#10;nurse.” Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to&#10;Nana’s eyes.&#10;&#10;“That fiend!” Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana’s bark was the echo of&#10;it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the&#10;right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.&#10;&#10;They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every&#10;smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully,&#10;so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the&#10;water for Michael’s bath and carrying him to it on her back.&#10;&#10;“I won’t go to bed,” he had shouted, like one who still believed that&#10;he had the last word on the subject, “I won’t, I won’t. Nana, it isn’t&#10;six o’clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan’t love you any more, Nana. I&#10;tell you I won’t be bathed, I won’t, I won’t!”&#10;&#10;Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had&#10;dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown,&#10;with the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy’s&#10;bracelet on her arm; she had asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to&#10;lend her bracelet to her mother.&#10;&#10;She had found her two older children playing at being herself and&#10;father on the occasion of Wendy’s birth, and John was saying:&#10;&#10;“I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,” in&#10;just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real&#10;occasion.&#10;&#10;Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have&#10;done.&#10;&#10;Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the&#10;birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also,&#10;but John said brutally that they did not want any more.&#10;&#10;Michael had nearly cried. “Nobody wants me,” he said, and of course the&#10;lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.&#10;&#10;“I do,” she said, “I so want a third child.”&#10;&#10;“Boy or girl?” asked Michael, not too hopefully.&#10;&#10;“Boy.”&#10;&#10;Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs.&#10;Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be&#10;Michael’s last night in the nursery.&#10;&#10;They go on with their recollections.&#10;&#10;“It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn’t it?” Mr. Darling&#10;would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.&#10;&#10;Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for&#10;the party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It&#10;is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew&#10;about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the&#10;thing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when&#10;it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride&#10;and used a made-up tie.&#10;&#10;This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the&#10;crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.&#10;&#10;“Why, what is the matter, father dear?”&#10;&#10;“Matter!” he yelled; he really yelled. “This tie, it will not tie.” He&#10;became dangerously sarcastic. “Not round my neck! Round the bed-post!&#10;Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my&#10;neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!”&#10;&#10;He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on&#10;sternly, “I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my&#10;neck we don’t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don’t go out to&#10;dinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don’t go to&#10;the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into&#10;the streets.”&#10;&#10;Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. “Let me try, dear,” she said, and&#10;indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice&#10;cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to&#10;see their fate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to&#10;do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he&#10;thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment&#10;was dancing round the room with Michael on his back.&#10;&#10;“How wildly we romped!” says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.&#10;&#10;“Our last romp!” Mr. Darling groaned.&#10;&#10;“O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, ‘How did you&#10;get to know me, mother?’”&#10;&#10;“I remember!”&#10;&#10;“They were rather sweet, don’t you think, George?”&#10;&#10;“And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.”&#10;&#10;The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr.&#10;Darling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They&#10;were not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had&#10;with braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears&#10;coming. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again&#10;about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.&#10;&#10;“George, Nana is a treasure.”&#10;&#10;“No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon&#10;the children as puppies.”&#10;&#10;“Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.”&#10;&#10;“I wonder,” Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, “I wonder.” It was an&#10;opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first he&#10;pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the&#10;shadow.&#10;&#10;“It is nobody I know,” he said, examining it carefully, “but it does&#10;look a scoundrel.”&#10;&#10;“We were still discussing it, you remember,” says Mr. Darling, “when&#10;Nana came in with Michael’s medicine. You will never carry the bottle&#10;in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.”&#10;&#10;Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather&#10;foolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking&#10;that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when&#10;Michael dodged the spoon in Nana’s mouth, he had said reprovingly, “Be&#10;a man, Michael.”&#10;&#10;“Won’t; won’t!” Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to&#10;get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of&#10;firmness.&#10;&#10;“Mother, don’t pamper him,” he called after her. “Michael, when I was&#10;your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said, ‘Thank you, kind&#10;parents, for giving me bottles to make me well.’”&#10;&#10;He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her&#10;night-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, “That&#10;medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn’t it?”&#10;&#10;“Ever so much nastier,” Mr. Darling said bravely, “and I would take it&#10;now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn’t lost the bottle.”&#10;&#10;He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the&#10;top of the wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that&#10;the faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.&#10;&#10;“I know where it is, father,” Wendy cried, always glad to be of&#10;service. “I’ll bring it,” and she was off before he could stop her.&#10;Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.&#10;&#10;“John,” he said, shuddering, “it’s most beastly stuff. It’s that nasty,&#10;sticky, sweet kind.”&#10;&#10;“It will soon be over, father,” John said cheerily, and then in rushed&#10;Wendy with the medicine in a glass.&#10;&#10;“I have been as quick as I could,” she panted.&#10;&#10;“You have been wonderfully quick,” her father retorted, with a&#10;vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. “Michael&#10;first,” he said doggedly.&#10;&#10;“Father first,” said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.&#10;&#10;“I shall be sick, you know,” Mr. Darling said threateningly.&#10;&#10;“Come on, father,” said John.&#10;&#10;“Hold your tongue, John,” his father rapped out.&#10;&#10;Wendy was quite puzzled. “I thought you took it quite easily, father.”&#10;&#10;“That is not the point,” he retorted. “The point is, that there is more&#10;in my glass than in Michael’s spoon.” His proud heart was nearly&#10;bursting. “And it isn’t fair: I would say it though it were with my&#10;last breath; it isn’t fair.”&#10;&#10;“Father, I am waiting,” said Michael coldly.&#10;&#10;“It’s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.”&#10;&#10;“Father’s a cowardly custard.”&#10;&#10;“So are you a cowardly custard.”&#10;&#10;“I’m not frightened.”&#10;&#10;“Neither am I frightened.”&#10;&#10;“Well, then, take it.”&#10;&#10;“Well, then, you take it.”&#10;&#10;Wendy had a splendid idea. “Why not both take it at the same time?”&#10;&#10;“Certainly,” said Mr. Darling. “Are you ready, Michael?”&#10;&#10;Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine,&#10;but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.&#10;&#10;There was a yell of rage from Michael, and “O father!” Wendy exclaimed.&#10;&#10;“What do you mean by ‘O father’?” Mr. Darling demanded. “Stop that row,&#10;Michael. I meant to take mine, but I—I missed it.”&#10;&#10;It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if&#10;they did not admire him. “Look here, all of you,” he said entreatingly,&#10;as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. “I have just thought of a&#10;splendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana’s bowl, and she will&#10;drink it, thinking it is milk!”&#10;&#10;It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father’s&#10;sense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the&#10;medicine into Nana’s bowl. “What fun!” he said doubtfully, and they did&#10;not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.&#10;&#10;“Nana, good dog,” he said, patting her, “I have put a little milk into&#10;your bowl, Nana.”&#10;&#10;Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then&#10;she gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the&#10;great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into&#10;her kennel.&#10;&#10;Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give&#10;in. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. “O George,” she&#10;said, “it’s your medicine!”&#10;&#10;“It was only a joke,” he roared, while she comforted her boys, and&#10;Wendy hugged Nana. “Much good,” he said bitterly, “my wearing myself to&#10;the bone trying to be funny in this house.”&#10;&#10;And still Wendy hugged Nana. “That’s right,” he shouted. “Coddle her!&#10;Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why should I&#10;be coddled—why, why, why!”&#10;&#10;“George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; the servants will&#10;hear you.” Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the&#10;servants.&#10;&#10;“Let them!” he answered recklessly. “Bring in the whole world. But I&#10;refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer.”&#10;&#10;The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her&#10;back. He felt he was a strong man again. “In vain, in vain,” he cried;&#10;“the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up&#10;this instant.”&#10;&#10;“George, George,” Mrs. Darling whispered, “remember what I told you&#10;about that boy.”&#10;&#10;Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in&#10;that house, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he&#10;lured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly,&#10;dragged her from the nursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did&#10;it. It was all owing to his too affectionate nature, which craved for&#10;admiration. When he had tied her up in the back-yard, the wretched&#10;father went and sat in the passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.&#10;&#10;In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted&#10;silence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and&#10;John whimpered, “It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,” but&#10;Wendy was wiser.&#10;&#10;“That is not Nana’s unhappy bark,” she said, little guessing what was&#10;about to happen; “that is her bark when she smells danger.”&#10;&#10;Danger!&#10;&#10;“Are you sure, Wendy?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, yes.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened.&#10;She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were&#10;crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place&#10;there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller&#10;ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made&#10;her cry, “Oh, how I wish that I wasn’t going to a party to-night!”&#10;&#10;Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he&#10;asked, “Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?”&#10;&#10;“Nothing, precious,” she said; “they are the eyes a mother leaves&#10;behind her to guard her children.”&#10;&#10;She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little&#10;Michael flung his arms round her. “Mother,” he cried, “I’m glad of&#10;you.” They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long&#10;time.&#10;&#10;No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall&#10;of snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly&#10;not to soil their shoes. They were already the only persons in the&#10;street, and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but&#10;they may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on&#10;for ever. It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long&#10;ago that no star now knows what it was. So the older ones have become&#10;glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the&#10;little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who&#10;had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow&#10;them out; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side&#10;to-night, and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon&#10;as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion&#10;in the firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way&#10;screamed out:&#10;&#10;“Now, Peter!”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter III.&#10;COME AWAY, COME AWAY!&#10;&#10;&#10;For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights&#10;by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were&#10;awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they&#10;could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy’s light blinked and gave&#10;such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close&#10;their mouths all the three went out.&#10;&#10;There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than&#10;the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had&#10;been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter’s shadow,&#10;rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not&#10;really a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but&#10;when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer&#10;than your hand, but still growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell&#10;exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through&#10;which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly&#10;inclined to _embonpoint_.&#10;&#10;A moment after the fairy’s entrance the window was blown open by the&#10;breathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried&#10;Tinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy with the&#10;fairy dust.&#10;&#10;“Tinker Bell,” he called softly, after making sure that the children&#10;were asleep, “Tink, where are you?” She was in a jug for the moment,&#10;and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.&#10;&#10;“Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put&#10;my shadow?”&#10;&#10;The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy&#10;language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to&#10;hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.&#10;&#10;Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of&#10;drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to&#10;the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha’pence to the crowd. In a&#10;moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that&#10;he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.&#10;&#10;If he thought at all, but I don’t believe he ever thought, it was that&#10;he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops&#10;of water, and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it&#10;on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed&#10;through Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.&#10;&#10;His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see&#10;a stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly&#10;interested.&#10;&#10;“Boy,” she said courteously, “why are you crying?”&#10;&#10;Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner&#10;at fairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was&#10;much pleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed.&#10;&#10;“What’s your name?” he asked.&#10;&#10;“Wendy Moira Angela Darling,” she replied with some satisfaction. “What&#10;is your name?”&#10;&#10;“Peter Pan.”&#10;&#10;She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a&#10;comparatively short name.&#10;&#10;“Is that all?”&#10;&#10;“Yes,” he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it was a&#10;shortish name.&#10;&#10;“I’m so sorry,” said Wendy Moira Angela.&#10;&#10;“It doesn’t matter,” Peter gulped.&#10;&#10;She asked where he lived.&#10;&#10;“Second to the right,” said Peter, “and then straight on till morning.”&#10;&#10;“What a funny address!”&#10;&#10;Peter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a&#10;funny address.&#10;&#10;“No, it isn’t,” he said.&#10;&#10;“I mean,” Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, “is that&#10;what they put on the letters?”&#10;&#10;He wished she had not mentioned letters.&#10;&#10;“Don’t get any letters,” he said contemptuously.&#10;&#10;“But your mother gets letters?”&#10;&#10;“Don’t have a mother,” he said. Not only had he no mother, but he had&#10;not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very over-rated&#10;persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a&#10;tragedy.&#10;&#10;“O Peter, no wonder you were crying,” she said, and got out of bed and&#10;ran to him.&#10;&#10;“I wasn’t crying about mothers,” he said rather indignantly. “I was&#10;crying because I can’t get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn’t&#10;crying.”&#10;&#10;“It has come off?”&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she&#10;was frightfully sorry for Peter. “How awful!” she said, but she could&#10;not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on&#10;with soap. How exactly like a boy!&#10;&#10;Fortunately she knew at once what to do. “It must be sewn on,” she&#10;said, just a little patronisingly.&#10;&#10;“What’s sewn?” he asked.&#10;&#10;“You’re dreadfully ignorant.”&#10;&#10;“No, I’m not.”&#10;&#10;But she was exulting in his ignorance. “I shall sew it on for you, my&#10;little man,” she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out&#10;her housewife, and sewed the shadow on to Peter’s foot.&#10;&#10;“I daresay it will hurt a little,” she warned him.&#10;&#10;“Oh, I shan’t cry,” said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he&#10;had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and did not cry,&#10;and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little&#10;creased.&#10;&#10;“Perhaps I should have ironed it,” Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter,&#10;boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about&#10;in the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his&#10;bliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. “How&#10;clever I am!” he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”&#10;&#10;It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one&#10;of his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness,&#10;there never was a cockier boy.&#10;&#10;But for the moment Wendy was shocked. “You conceit,” she exclaimed,&#10;with frightful sarcasm; “of course I did nothing!”&#10;&#10;“You did a little,” Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.&#10;&#10;“A little!” she replied with hauteur; “if I am no use I can at least&#10;withdraw,” and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and&#10;covered her face with the blankets.&#10;&#10;To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this&#10;failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his&#10;foot. “Wendy,” he said, “don’t withdraw. I can’t help crowing, Wendy,&#10;when I’m pleased with myself.” Still she would not look up, though she&#10;was listening eagerly. “Wendy,” he continued, in a voice that no woman&#10;has ever yet been able to resist, “Wendy, one girl is more use than&#10;twenty boys.”&#10;&#10;Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many&#10;inches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.&#10;&#10;“Do you really think so, Peter?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, I do.”&#10;&#10;“I think it’s perfectly sweet of you,” she declared, “and I’ll get up&#10;again,” and she sat with him on the side of the bed. She also said she&#10;would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not know what she&#10;meant, and he held out his hand expectantly.&#10;&#10;“Surely you know what a kiss is?” she asked, aghast.&#10;&#10;“I shall know when you give it to me,” he replied stiffly, and not to&#10;hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.&#10;&#10;“Now,” said he, “shall I give you a kiss?” and she replied with a&#10;slight primness, “If you please.” She made herself rather cheap by&#10;inclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn button&#10;into her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been&#10;before, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain&#10;around her neck. It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it&#10;was afterwards to save her life.&#10;&#10;When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask&#10;each other’s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct&#10;thing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question&#10;to ask him; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when&#10;what you want to be asked is Kings of England.&#10;&#10;“I don’t know,” he replied uneasily, “but I am quite young.” He really&#10;knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said at a&#10;venture, “Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.”&#10;&#10;Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the&#10;charming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he&#10;could sit nearer her.&#10;&#10;“It was because I heard father and mother,” he explained in a low&#10;voice, “talking about what I was to be when I became a man.” He was&#10;extraordinarily agitated now. “I don’t want ever to be a man,” he said&#10;with passion. “I want always to be a little boy and to have fun. So I&#10;ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the&#10;fairies.”&#10;&#10;She gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it&#10;was because he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies.&#10;Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as&#10;quite delightful. She poured out questions about them, to his surprise,&#10;for they were rather a nuisance to him, getting in his way and so on,&#10;and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding. Still, he liked them&#10;on the whole, and he told her about the beginning of fairies.&#10;&#10;“You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its&#10;laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about,&#10;and that was the beginning of fairies.”&#10;&#10;Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.&#10;&#10;“And so,” he went on good-naturedly, “there ought to be one fairy for&#10;every boy and girl.”&#10;&#10;“Ought to be? Isn’t there?”&#10;&#10;“No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don’t believe in&#10;fairies, and every time a child says, ‘I don’t believe in fairies,’&#10;there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.”&#10;&#10;Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it&#10;struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. “I can’t think&#10;where she has gone to,” he said, rising, and he called Tink by name.&#10;Wendy’s heart went flutter with a sudden thrill.&#10;&#10;“Peter,” she cried, clutching him, “you don’t mean to tell me that&#10;there is a fairy in this room!”&#10;&#10;“She was here just now,” he said a little impatiently. “You don’t hear&#10;her, do you?” and they both listened.&#10;&#10;“The only sound I hear,” said Wendy, “is like a tinkle of bells.”&#10;&#10;“Well, that’s Tink, that’s the fairy language. I think I hear her too.”&#10;&#10;The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face.&#10;No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of&#10;gurgles was his laugh. He had his first laugh still.&#10;&#10;“Wendy,” he whispered gleefully, “I do believe I shut her up in the&#10;drawer!”&#10;&#10;He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery&#10;screaming with fury. “You shouldn’t say such things,” Peter retorted.&#10;“Of course I’m very sorry, but how could I know you were in the&#10;drawer?”&#10;&#10;Wendy was not listening to him. “O Peter,” she cried, “if she would&#10;only stand still and let me see her!”&#10;&#10;“They hardly ever stand still,” he said, but for one moment Wendy saw&#10;the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. “O the lovely!”&#10;she cried, though Tink’s face was still distorted with passion.&#10;&#10;“Tink,” said Peter amiably, “this lady says she wishes you were her&#10;fairy.”&#10;&#10;Tinker Bell answered insolently.&#10;&#10;“What does she say, Peter?”&#10;&#10;He had to translate. “She is not very polite. She says you are a great&#10;ugly girl, and that she is my fairy.”&#10;&#10;He tried to argue with Tink. “You know you can’t be my fairy, Tink,&#10;because I am an gentleman and you are a lady.”&#10;&#10;To this Tink replied in these words, “You silly ass,” and disappeared&#10;into the bathroom. “She is quite a common fairy,” Peter explained&#10;apologetically, “she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots&#10;and kettles.”&#10;&#10;They were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him&#10;with more questions.&#10;&#10;“If you don’t live in Kensington Gardens now—”&#10;&#10;“Sometimes I do still.”&#10;&#10;“But where do you live mostly now?”&#10;&#10;“With the lost boys.”&#10;&#10;“Who are they?”&#10;&#10;“They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the&#10;nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days&#10;they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I’m&#10;captain.”&#10;&#10;“What fun it must be!”&#10;&#10;“Yes,” said cunning Peter, “but we are rather lonely. You see we have&#10;no female companionship.”&#10;&#10;“Are none of the others girls?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their&#10;prams.”&#10;&#10;This flattered Wendy immensely. “I think,” she said, “it is perfectly&#10;lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us.”&#10;&#10;For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one&#10;kick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she&#10;told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house. However,&#10;John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him&#10;to remain there. “And I know you meant to be kind,” she said,&#10;relenting, “so you may give me a kiss.”&#10;&#10;For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. “I thought&#10;you would want it back,” he said a little bitterly, and offered to&#10;return her the thimble.&#10;&#10;“Oh dear,” said the nice Wendy, “I don’t mean a kiss, I mean a&#10;thimble.”&#10;&#10;“What’s that?”&#10;&#10;“It’s like this.” She kissed him.&#10;&#10;“Funny!” said Peter gravely. “Now shall I give you a thimble?”&#10;&#10;“If you wish to,” said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.&#10;&#10;Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. “What is it,&#10;Wendy?”&#10;&#10;“It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.”&#10;&#10;“That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.”&#10;&#10;And indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.&#10;&#10;“She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you a&#10;thimble.”&#10;&#10;“But why?”&#10;&#10;“Why, Tink?”&#10;&#10;Again Tink replied, “You silly ass.” Peter could not understand why,&#10;but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he&#10;admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to&#10;listen to stories.&#10;&#10;“You see, I don’t know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any&#10;stories.”&#10;&#10;“How perfectly awful,” Wendy said.&#10;&#10;“Do you know,” Peter asked “why swallows build in the eaves of houses?&#10;It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you&#10;such a lovely story.”&#10;&#10;“Which story was it?”&#10;&#10;“About the prince who couldn’t find the lady who wore the glass&#10;slipper.”&#10;&#10;“Peter,” said Wendy excitedly, “that was Cinderella, and he found her,&#10;and they lived happily ever after.”&#10;&#10;Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been&#10;sitting, and hurried to the window.&#10;&#10;“Where are you going?” she cried with misgiving.&#10;&#10;“To tell the other boys.”&#10;&#10;“Don’t go Peter,” she entreated, “I know such lots of stories.”&#10;&#10;Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was&#10;she who first tempted him.&#10;&#10;He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought&#10;to have alarmed her, but did not.&#10;&#10;“Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!” she cried, and then Peter&#10;gripped her and began to draw her toward the window.&#10;&#10;“Let me go!” she ordered him.&#10;&#10;“Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.”&#10;&#10;Of course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, “Oh dear, I&#10;can’t. Think of mummy! Besides, I can’t fly.”&#10;&#10;“I’ll teach you.”&#10;&#10;“Oh, how lovely to fly.”&#10;&#10;“I’ll teach you how to jump on the wind’s back, and then away we go.”&#10;&#10;“Oo!” she exclaimed rapturously.&#10;&#10;“Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be&#10;flying about with me saying funny things to the stars.”&#10;&#10;“Oo!”&#10;&#10;“And, Wendy, there are mermaids.”&#10;&#10;“Mermaids! With tails?”&#10;&#10;“Such long tails.”&#10;&#10;“Oh,” cried Wendy, “to see a mermaid!”&#10;&#10;He had become frightfully cunning. “Wendy,” he said, “how we should all&#10;respect you.”&#10;&#10;She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were&#10;trying to remain on the nursery floor.&#10;&#10;But he had no pity for her.&#10;&#10;“Wendy,” he said, the sly one, “you could tuck us in at night.”&#10;&#10;“Oo!”&#10;&#10;“None of us has ever been tucked in at night.”&#10;&#10;“Oo,” and her arms went out to him.&#10;&#10;“And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us&#10;has any pockets.”&#10;&#10;How could she resist. “Of course it’s awfully fascinating!” she cried.&#10;“Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?”&#10;&#10;“If you like,” he said indifferently, and she ran to John and Michael&#10;and shook them. “Wake up,” she cried, “Peter Pan has come and he is to&#10;teach us to fly.”&#10;&#10;John rubbed his eyes. “Then I shall get up,” he said. Of course he was&#10;on the floor already. “Hallo,” he said, “I am up!”&#10;&#10;Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six&#10;blades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces&#10;assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the&#10;grown-up world. All was as still as salt. Then everything was right.&#10;No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking&#10;distressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was her silence they&#10;had heard.&#10;&#10;“Out with the light! Hide! Quick!” cried John, taking command for the&#10;only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered,&#10;holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you&#10;would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing&#10;angelically as they slept. They were really doing it artfully from&#10;behind the window curtains.&#10;&#10;Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in&#10;the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her&#10;cheek, by Nana’s absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting&#10;a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in&#10;custody of course.&#10;&#10;“There, you suspicious brute,” she said, not sorry that Nana was in&#10;disgrace. “They are perfectly safe, aren’t they? Every one of the&#10;little angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.”&#10;&#10;Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they&#10;were nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried&#10;to drag herself out of Liza’s clutches.&#10;&#10;But Liza was dense. “No more of it, Nana,” she said sternly, pulling&#10;her out of the room. “I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight&#10;for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh,&#10;won’t master whip you, just.”&#10;&#10;She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to&#10;bark? Bring master and missus home from the party! Why, that was just&#10;what she wanted. Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long&#10;as her charges were safe? Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings,&#10;and Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and&#10;strained at the chain until at last she broke it. In another moment she&#10;had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven,&#10;her most expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs. Darling&#10;knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery,&#10;and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.&#10;&#10;But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing&#10;behind the curtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.&#10;&#10;We now return to the nursery.&#10;&#10;“It’s all right,” John announced, emerging from his hiding-place. “I&#10;say, Peter, can you really fly?”&#10;&#10;Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking&#10;the mantelpiece on the way.&#10;&#10;“How topping!” said John and Michael.&#10;&#10;“How sweet!” cried Wendy.&#10;&#10;“Yes, I’m sweet, oh, I am sweet!” said Peter, forgetting his manners&#10;again.&#10;&#10;It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and&#10;then from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.&#10;&#10;“I say, how do you do it?” asked John, rubbing his knee. He was quite a&#10;practical boy.&#10;&#10;“You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,” Peter explained, “and they&#10;lift you up in the air.”&#10;&#10;He showed them again.&#10;&#10;“You’re so nippy at it,” John said, “couldn’t you do it very slowly&#10;once?”&#10;&#10;Peter did it both slowly and quickly. “I’ve got it now, Wendy!” cried&#10;John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch,&#10;though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not&#10;know A from Z.&#10;&#10;Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless&#10;the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have&#10;mentioned, one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each&#10;of them, with the most superb results.&#10;&#10;“Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,” he said, “and let go.”&#10;&#10;They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did&#10;not quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne&#10;across the room.&#10;&#10;“I flewed!” he screamed while still in mid-air.&#10;&#10;John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.&#10;&#10;“Oh, lovely!”&#10;&#10;“Oh, ripping!”&#10;&#10;“Look at me!”&#10;&#10;“Look at me!”&#10;&#10;“Look at me!”&#10;&#10;They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a&#10;little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is&#10;almost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first,&#10;but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.&#10;&#10;Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy’s word.&#10;&#10;“I say,” cried John, “why shouldn’t we all go out?”&#10;&#10;Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.&#10;&#10;Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a&#10;billion miles. But Wendy hesitated.&#10;&#10;“Mermaids!” said Peter again.&#10;&#10;“Oo!”&#10;&#10;“And there are pirates.”&#10;&#10;“Pirates,” cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, “let us go at once.”&#10;&#10;It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana&#10;out of 27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the&#10;nursery window; and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze&#10;with light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, they could see in&#10;shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling&#10;round and round, not on the floor but in the air.&#10;&#10;Not three figures, four!&#10;&#10;In a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushed&#10;upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to&#10;make her heart go softly.&#10;&#10;Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them,&#10;and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story.&#10;On the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it&#10;will all come right in the end.&#10;&#10;They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the&#10;little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window&#10;open, and that smallest star of all called out:&#10;&#10;“Cave, Peter!”&#10;&#10;Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. “Come,” he cried&#10;imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John&#10;and Michael and Wendy.&#10;&#10;Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The&#10;birds were flown.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter IV.&#10;THE FLIGHT&#10;&#10;&#10;“Second to the right, and straight on till morning.”&#10;&#10;That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even&#10;birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not&#10;have sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said&#10;anything that came into his head.&#10;&#10;At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the&#10;delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires&#10;or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.&#10;&#10;John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.&#10;&#10;They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought&#10;themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.&#10;&#10;Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before&#10;this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was&#10;their second sea and their third night.&#10;&#10;Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold&#10;and again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they&#10;merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding&#10;them? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable&#10;for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and&#10;snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for&#10;miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy&#10;noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this&#10;was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that&#10;there are other ways.&#10;&#10;Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that&#10;was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful&#10;thing was that Peter thought this funny.&#10;&#10;“There he goes again!” he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly&#10;dropped like a stone.&#10;&#10;“Save him, save him!” cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel sea&#10;far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch&#10;Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way&#10;he did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it&#10;was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human&#10;life. Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one&#10;moment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the&#10;possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go.&#10;&#10;He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back&#10;and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light&#10;that if you got behind him and blew he went faster.&#10;&#10;“Do be more polite to him,” Wendy whispered to John, when they were&#10;playing “Follow my Leader.”&#10;&#10;“Then tell him to stop showing off,” said John.&#10;&#10;When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and&#10;touch each shark’s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run&#10;your finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this&#10;with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off,&#10;especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.&#10;&#10;“You must be nice to him,” Wendy impressed on her brothers. “What could&#10;we do if he were to leave us!”&#10;&#10;“We could go back,” Michael said.&#10;&#10;“How could we ever find our way back without him?”&#10;&#10;“Well, then, we could go on,” said John.&#10;&#10;“That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we don’t&#10;know how to stop.”&#10;&#10;This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.&#10;&#10;John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was&#10;to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must&#10;come back to their own window.&#10;&#10;“And who is to get food for us, John?”&#10;&#10;“I nipped a bit out of that eagle’s mouth pretty neatly, Wendy.”&#10;&#10;“After the twentieth try,” Wendy reminded him. “And even though we&#10;became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and&#10;things if he is not near to give us a hand.”&#10;&#10;Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly,&#10;though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front&#10;of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they&#10;bump into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage&#10;round Michael’s forehead by this time.&#10;&#10;Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up&#10;there by themselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would&#10;suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had&#10;no share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he&#10;had been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or&#10;he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not&#10;be able to say for certain what had been happening. It was really&#10;rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.&#10;&#10;“And if he forgets them so quickly,” Wendy argued, “how can we expect&#10;that he will go on remembering us?”&#10;&#10;Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least&#10;not well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes&#10;as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she&#10;had to call him by name.&#10;&#10;“I’m Wendy,” she said agitatedly.&#10;&#10;He was very sorry. “I say, Wendy,” he whispered to her, “always if you&#10;see me forgetting you, just keep on saying ‘I’m Wendy,’ and then I’ll&#10;remember.”&#10;&#10;Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he&#10;showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their&#10;way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several&#10;times and found that they could sleep thus with security. Indeed they&#10;would have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon&#10;he would cry in his captain voice, “We get off here.” So with&#10;occasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the&#10;Neverland; for after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more,&#10;they had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much&#10;owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was&#10;looking for them. It is only thus that any one may sight those magic&#10;shores.&#10;&#10;“There it is,” said Peter calmly.&#10;&#10;“Where, where?”&#10;&#10;“Where all the arrows are pointing.”&#10;&#10;Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children,&#10;all directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of&#10;their way before leaving them for the night.&#10;&#10;Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their&#10;first sight of the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at&#10;once, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something&#10;long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom they&#10;were returning home for the holidays.&#10;&#10;“John, there’s the lagoon.”&#10;&#10;“Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.”&#10;&#10;“I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!”&#10;&#10;“Look, Michael, there’s your cave!”&#10;&#10;“John, what’s that in the brushwood?”&#10;&#10;“It’s a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that’s your little&#10;whelp!”&#10;&#10;“There’s my boat, John, with her sides stove in!”&#10;&#10;“No, it isn’t. Why, we burned your boat.”&#10;&#10;“That’s her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the redskin&#10;camp!”&#10;&#10;“Where? Show me, and I’ll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they&#10;are on the war-path.”&#10;&#10;“There, just across the Mysterious River.”&#10;&#10;“I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.”&#10;&#10;Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he&#10;wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not&#10;told you that anon fear fell upon them?&#10;&#10;It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.&#10;&#10;In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little&#10;dark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it&#10;and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts&#10;of prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty&#10;that you would win. You were quite glad that the night-lights were on.&#10;You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over&#10;here, and that the Neverland was all make-believe.&#10;&#10;Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was&#10;real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker&#10;every moment, and where was Nana?&#10;&#10;They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His&#10;careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle&#10;went through them every time they touched his body. They were now over&#10;the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their&#10;feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had&#10;become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way&#10;through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had&#10;beaten on it with his fists.&#10;&#10;“They don’t want us to land,” he explained.&#10;&#10;“Who are they?” Wendy whispered, shuddering.&#10;&#10;But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his&#10;shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.&#10;&#10;Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his&#10;hand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that&#10;they seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he&#10;went on again.&#10;&#10;His courage was almost appalling. “Would you like an adventure now,” he&#10;said casually to John, “or would you like to have your tea first?”&#10;&#10;Wendy said “tea first” quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in&#10;gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.&#10;&#10;“What kind of adventure?” he asked cautiously.&#10;&#10;“There’s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,” Peter told&#10;him. “If you like, we’ll go down and kill him.”&#10;&#10;“I don’t see him,” John said after a long pause.&#10;&#10;“I do.”&#10;&#10;“Suppose,” John said, a little huskily, “he were to wake up.”&#10;&#10;Peter spoke indignantly. “You don’t think I would kill him while he was&#10;sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That’s the way I&#10;always do.”&#10;&#10;“I say! Do you kill many?”&#10;&#10;“Tons.”&#10;&#10;John said “How ripping,” but decided to have tea first. He asked if&#10;there were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had&#10;never known so many.&#10;&#10;“Who is captain now?”&#10;&#10;“Hook,” answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said that&#10;hated word.&#10;&#10;“Jas. Hook?”&#10;&#10;“Ay.”&#10;&#10;Then indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps&#10;only, for they knew Hook’s reputation.&#10;&#10;“He was Blackbeard’s bo’sun,” John whispered huskily. “He is the worst&#10;of them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid.”&#10;&#10;“That’s him,” said Peter.&#10;&#10;“What is he like? Is he big?”&#10;&#10;“He is not so big as he was.”&#10;&#10;“How do you mean?”&#10;&#10;“I cut off a bit of him.”&#10;&#10;“You!”&#10;&#10;“Yes, me,” said Peter sharply.&#10;&#10;“I wasn’t meaning to be disrespectful.”&#10;&#10;“Oh, all right.”&#10;&#10;“But, I say, what bit?”&#10;&#10;“His right hand.”&#10;&#10;“Then he can’t fight now?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, can’t he just!”&#10;&#10;“Left-hander?”&#10;&#10;“He has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws with it.”&#10;&#10;“Claws!”&#10;&#10;“I say, John,” said Peter.&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;“Say, ‘Ay, ay, sir.’”&#10;&#10;“Ay, ay, sir.”&#10;&#10;“There is one thing,” Peter continued, “that every boy who serves under&#10;me has to promise, and so must you.”&#10;&#10;John paled.&#10;&#10;“It is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him to me.”&#10;&#10;“I promise,” John said loyally.&#10;&#10;For the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying&#10;with them, and in her light they could distinguish each other.&#10;Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they, and so she had to go&#10;round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo.&#10;Wendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks.&#10;&#10;“She tells me,” he said, “that the pirates sighted us before the&#10;darkness came, and got Long Tom out.”&#10;&#10;“The big gun?”&#10;&#10;“Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we are&#10;near it they are sure to let fly.”&#10;&#10;“Wendy!”&#10;&#10;“John!”&#10;&#10;“Michael!”&#10;&#10;“Tell her to go away at once, Peter,” the three cried simultaneously,&#10;but he refused.&#10;&#10;“She thinks we have lost the way,” he replied stiffly, “and she is&#10;rather frightened. You don’t think I would send her away all by herself&#10;when she is frightened!”&#10;&#10;For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a&#10;loving little pinch.&#10;&#10;“Then tell her,” Wendy begged, “to put out her light.”&#10;&#10;“She can’t put it out. That is about the only thing fairies can’t do.&#10;It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the stars.”&#10;&#10;“Then tell her to sleep at once,” John almost ordered.&#10;&#10;“She can’t sleep except when she’s sleepy. It is the only other thing&#10;fairies can’t do.”&#10;&#10;“Seems to me,” growled John, “these are the only two things worth&#10;doing.”&#10;&#10;Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one.&#10;&#10;“If only one of us had a pocket,” Peter said, “we could carry her in&#10;it.” However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a&#10;pocket between the four of them.&#10;&#10;He had a happy idea. John’s hat!&#10;&#10;Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John&#10;carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently&#10;Wendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he&#10;flew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated&#10;to be under an obligation to Wendy.&#10;&#10;In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on&#10;in silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken&#10;once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts&#10;drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been&#10;the branches of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins&#10;sharpening their knives.&#10;&#10;Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. “If&#10;only something would make a sound!” he cried.&#10;&#10;As if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous&#10;crash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.&#10;&#10;The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to&#10;cry savagely, “Where are they, where are they, where are they?”&#10;&#10;Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an&#10;island of make-believe and the same island come true.&#10;&#10;When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found&#10;themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air&#10;mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.&#10;&#10;“Are you shot?” John whispered tremulously.&#10;&#10;“I haven’t tried yet,” Michael whispered back.&#10;&#10;We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried&#10;by the wind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards&#10;with no companion but Tinker Bell.&#10;&#10;It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the&#10;hat.&#10;&#10;I don’t know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had&#10;planned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began&#10;to lure Wendy to her destruction.&#10;&#10;Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the&#10;other hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or&#10;the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one&#10;feeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it&#10;must be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of&#10;Wendy. What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course&#10;understand, and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded&#10;kind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning “Follow me, and&#10;all will be well.”&#10;&#10;What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and&#10;Michael, and got only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know&#10;that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. And so,&#10;bewildered, and now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to her&#10;doom.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter V.&#10;THE ISLAND COME TRUE&#10;&#10;&#10;Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke&#10;into life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is&#10;better and was always used by Peter.&#10;&#10;In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take&#10;an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the&#10;redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and&#10;lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with&#10;the coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if&#10;you put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island&#10;seething with life.&#10;&#10;On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as&#10;follows. The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out&#10;looking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the&#10;pirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins. They were&#10;going round and round the island, but they did not meet because all&#10;were going at the same rate.&#10;&#10;All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night&#10;were out to greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of&#10;course, in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when&#10;they seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins&#10;them out; but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins&#10;as two. Let us pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them&#10;as they steal by in single file, each with his hand on his dagger.&#10;&#10;They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they&#10;wear the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so&#10;round and furry that when they fall they roll. They have therefore&#10;become very sure-footed.&#10;&#10;The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most&#10;unfortunate of all that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures&#10;than any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when&#10;he had stepped round the corner; all would be quiet, he would take the&#10;opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and then&#10;when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This&#10;ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance, but instead&#10;of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was quite the&#10;humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for&#10;you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if&#10;accepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who&#10;is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool, and she thinks&#10;you are the most easily tricked of the boys. ’Ware Tinker Bell.&#10;&#10;Would that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and&#10;he passes by, biting his knuckles.&#10;&#10;Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts&#10;whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes.&#10;Slightly is the most conceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the&#10;days before he was lost, with their manners and customs, and this has&#10;given his nose an offensive tilt. Curly is fourth; he is a pickle, and&#10;so often has he had to deliver up his person when Peter said sternly,&#10;“Stand forth the one who did this thing,” that now at the command he&#10;stands forth automatically whether he has done it or not. Last come the&#10;Twins, who cannot be described because we should be sure to be&#10;describing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what twins were, and&#10;his band were not allowed to know anything he did not know, so these&#10;two were always vague about themselves, and did their best to give&#10;satisfaction by keeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.&#10;&#10;The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause,&#10;for things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track.&#10;We hear them before they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful&#10;song:&#10;&#10;“Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,&#10;    A-pirating we go,&#10;And if we’re parted by a shot&#10;    We’re sure to meet below!”&#10;&#10;A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock.&#10;Here, a little in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground&#10;listening, his great arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as&#10;ornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his name in letters&#10;of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao. That&#10;gigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one&#10;with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of&#10;the Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the same&#10;Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the _Walrus_ from Flint before he would&#10;drop the bag of moidores; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy’s&#10;brother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an&#10;usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and&#10;Skylights (Morgan’s Skylights); and the Irish bo’sun Smee, an oddly&#10;genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only&#10;Non-conformist in Hook’s crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on&#10;backwards; and Robt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian&#10;long known and feared on the Spanish Main.&#10;&#10;In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting,&#10;reclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is&#10;said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease&#10;in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men, and instead of a&#10;right hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged&#10;them to increase their pace. As dogs this terrible man treated and&#10;addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person he was&#10;cadaverous and blackavized, and his hair was dressed in long curls,&#10;which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a&#10;singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes&#10;were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy,&#10;save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red&#10;spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly. In manner, something&#10;of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even ripped you up&#10;with an air, and I have been told that he was a _raconteur_ of repute.&#10;He was never more sinister than when he was most polite, which is&#10;probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his diction,&#10;even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his&#10;demeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of&#10;indomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was&#10;the sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour.&#10;In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of&#10;Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career&#10;that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his&#10;mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke&#10;two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his&#10;iron claw.&#10;&#10;Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook’s method. Skylights will do. As&#10;they pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace&#10;collar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one&#10;screech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has&#10;not even taken the cigars from his mouth.&#10;&#10;Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will&#10;win?&#10;&#10;On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path,&#10;which is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every&#10;one of them with his eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and&#10;their naked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around them are&#10;scalps, of boys as well as of pirates, for these are the Piccaninny&#10;tribe, and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the&#10;Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great Big Little Panther, a brave&#10;of so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his&#10;progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes&#10;Tiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is the most&#10;beautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies,&#10;coquettish, cold and amorous by turns; there is not a brave who would&#10;not have the wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a&#10;hatchet. Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the&#10;slightest noise. The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy&#10;breathing. The fact is that they are all a little fat just now after&#10;the heavy gorging, but in time they will work this off. For the moment,&#10;however, it constitutes their chief danger.&#10;&#10;The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their&#10;place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions,&#10;tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from&#10;them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the&#10;man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. Their tongues&#10;are hanging out, they are hungry to-night.&#10;&#10;When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic&#10;crocodile. We shall see for whom she is looking presently.&#10;&#10;The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the&#10;procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or&#10;changes its pace. Then quickly they will be on top of each other.&#10;&#10;All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the&#10;danger may be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island&#10;was.&#10;&#10;The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung&#10;themselves down on the sward, close to their underground home.&#10;&#10;“I do wish Peter would come back,” every one of them said nervously,&#10;though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than&#10;their captain.&#10;&#10;“I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,” Slightly said, in&#10;the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps some&#10;distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, “but I wish he would&#10;come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about&#10;Cinderella.”&#10;&#10;They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother&#10;must have been very like her.&#10;&#10;It was only in Peter’s absence that they could speak of mothers, the&#10;subject being forbidden by him as silly.&#10;&#10;“All I remember about my mother,” Nibs told them, “is that she often&#10;said to my father, ‘Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!’ I&#10;don’t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my&#10;mother one.”&#10;&#10;While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild&#10;things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and&#10;it was the grim song:&#10;&#10;“Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,&#10;    The flag o’ skull and bones,&#10;A merry hour, a hempen rope,&#10;    And hey for Davy Jones.”&#10;&#10;At once the lost boys—but where are they? They are no longer there.&#10;Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.&#10;&#10;I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has&#10;darted away to reconnoitre, they are already in their home under the&#10;ground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal&#10;presently. But how have they reached it? for there is no entrance to be&#10;seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away, would&#10;disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and you may note&#10;that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its hollow&#10;trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the home&#10;under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many&#10;moons. Will he find it tonight?&#10;&#10;As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs&#10;disappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But&#10;an iron claw gripped his shoulder.&#10;&#10;“Captain, let go!” he cried, writhing.&#10;&#10;Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.&#10;“Put back that pistol first,” it said threateningly.&#10;&#10;“It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.”&#10;&#10;“Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily’s redskins upon us. Do&#10;you want to lose your scalp?”&#10;&#10;“Shall I after him, Captain,” asked pathetic Smee, “and tickle him with&#10;Johnny Corkscrew?” Smee had pleasant names for everything, and his&#10;cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the wound. One&#10;could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after killing,&#10;it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.&#10;&#10;“Johnny’s a silent fellow,” he reminded Hook.&#10;&#10;“Not now, Smee,” Hook said darkly. “He is only one, and I want to&#10;mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.”&#10;&#10;The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain&#10;and Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it&#10;was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but&#10;there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo’sun the&#10;story of his life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all&#10;about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.&#10;&#10;Anon he caught the word Peter.&#10;&#10;“Most of all,” Hook was saying passionately, “I want their captain,&#10;Peter Pan. ’Twas he cut off my arm.” He brandished the hook&#10;threateningly. “I’ve waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I’ll&#10;tear him!”&#10;&#10;“And yet,” said Smee, “I have often heard you say that hook was worth a&#10;score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.”&#10;&#10;“Ay,” the captain answered, “if I was a mother I would pray to have my&#10;children born with this instead of that,” and he cast a look of pride&#10;upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he&#10;frowned.&#10;&#10;“Peter flung my arm,” he said, wincing, “to a crocodile that happened&#10;to be passing by.”&#10;&#10;“I have often,” said Smee, “noticed your strange dread of crocodiles.”&#10;&#10;“Not of crocodiles,” Hook corrected him, “but of that one crocodile.”&#10;He lowered his voice. “It liked my arm so much, Smee, that it has&#10;followed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking&#10;its lips for the rest of me.”&#10;&#10;“In a way,” said Smee, “it’s sort of a compliment.”&#10;&#10;“I want no such compliments,” Hook barked petulantly. “I want Peter&#10;Pan, who first gave the brute its taste for me.”&#10;&#10;He sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his&#10;voice. “Smee,” he said huskily, “that crocodile would have had me&#10;before this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick&#10;tick inside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and&#10;bolt.” He laughed, but in a hollow way.&#10;&#10;“Some day,” said Smee, “the clock will run down, and then he’ll get&#10;you.”&#10;&#10;Hook wetted his dry lips. “Ay,” he said, “that’s the fear that haunts&#10;me.”&#10;&#10;Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm. “Smee,” he said, “this&#10;seat is hot.” He jumped up. “Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I’m burning.”&#10;&#10;They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on&#10;the mainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in&#10;their hands, for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to&#10;ascend. The pirates looked at each other. “A chimney!” they both&#10;exclaimed.&#10;&#10;They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It&#10;was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were&#10;in the neighbourhood.&#10;&#10;Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children’s voices, for&#10;so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily&#10;chattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the&#10;mushroom. They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven&#10;trees.&#10;&#10;“Did you hear them say Peter Pan’s from home?” Smee whispered,&#10;fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.&#10;&#10;Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a&#10;curdling smile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it.&#10;“Unrip your plan, captain,” he cried eagerly.&#10;&#10;“To return to the ship,” Hook replied slowly through his teeth, “and&#10;cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.&#10;There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The&#10;silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door&#10;apiece. That shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the&#10;shore of the Mermaids’ Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about&#10;there, playing with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will&#10;gobble it up, because, having no mother, they don’t know how dangerous&#10;’tis to eat rich damp cake.” He burst into laughter, not hollow&#10;laughter now, but honest laughter. “Aha, they will die.”&#10;&#10;Smee had listened with growing admiration.&#10;&#10;“It’s the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!” he cried, and&#10;in their exultation they danced and sang:&#10;&#10;“Avast, belay, when I appear,&#10;    By fear they’re overtook;&#10;Nought’s left upon your bones when you&#10;    Have shaken claws with Hook.”&#10;&#10;They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound&#10;broke in and stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a&#10;leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it&#10;was more distinct.&#10;&#10;Tick tick tick tick!&#10;&#10;Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.&#10;&#10;“The crocodile!” he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his bo’sun.&#10;&#10;It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now&#10;on the trail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.&#10;&#10;Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night&#10;were not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their&#10;midst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were&#10;hanging out; the baying of them was horrible.&#10;&#10;“Save me, save me!” cried Nibs, falling on the ground.&#10;&#10;“But what can we do, what can we do?”&#10;&#10;It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their&#10;thoughts turned to him.&#10;&#10;“What would Peter do?” they cried simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Almost in the same breath they cried, “Peter would look at them through&#10;his legs.”&#10;&#10;And then, “Let us do what Peter would do.”&#10;&#10;It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy&#10;they bent and looked through their legs. The next moment is the long&#10;one, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in&#10;the terrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails and fled.&#10;&#10;Now Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring&#10;eyes still saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.&#10;&#10;“I have seen a wonderfuller thing,” he cried, as they gathered round&#10;him eagerly. “A great white bird. It is flying this way.”&#10;&#10;“What kind of a bird, do you think?”&#10;&#10;“I don’t know,” Nibs said, awestruck, “but it looks so weary, and as it&#10;flies it moans, ‘Poor Wendy.’”&#10;&#10;“Poor Wendy?”&#10;&#10;“I remember,” said Slightly instantly, “there are birds called&#10;Wendies.”&#10;&#10;“See, it comes!” cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.&#10;&#10;Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry.&#10;But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous&#10;fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting at&#10;her victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time she&#10;touched.&#10;&#10;“Hullo, Tink,” cried the wondering boys.&#10;&#10;Tink’s reply rang out: “Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy.”&#10;&#10;It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. “Let us do&#10;what Peter wishes!” cried the simple boys. “Quick, bows and arrows!”&#10;&#10;All but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with&#10;him, and Tink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.&#10;&#10;“Quick, Tootles, quick,” she screamed. “Peter will be so pleased.”&#10;&#10;Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. “Out of the way, Tink,”&#10;he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground with&#10;an arrow in her breast.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter VI.&#10;THE LITTLE HOUSE&#10;&#10;&#10;Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy’s body when&#10;the other boys sprang, armed, from their trees.&#10;&#10;“You are too late,” he cried proudly, “I have shot the Wendy. Peter&#10;will be so pleased with me.”&#10;&#10;Overhead Tinker Bell shouted “Silly ass!” and darted into hiding. The&#10;others did not hear her. They had crowded round Wendy, and as they&#10;looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy’s heart had been&#10;beating they would all have heard it.&#10;&#10;Slightly was the first to speak. “This is no bird,” he said in a scared&#10;voice. “I think this must be a lady.”&#10;&#10;“A lady?” said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.&#10;&#10;“And we have killed her,” Nibs said hoarsely.&#10;&#10;They all whipped off their caps.&#10;&#10;“Now I see,” Curly said: “Peter was bringing her to us.” He threw&#10;himself sorrowfully on the ground.&#10;&#10;“A lady to take care of us at last,” said one of the twins, “and you&#10;have killed her!”&#10;&#10;They were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a&#10;step nearer them they turned from him.&#10;&#10;Tootles’ face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now&#10;that had never been there before.&#10;&#10;“I did it,” he said, reflecting. “When ladies used to come to me in&#10;dreams, I said, ‘Pretty mother, pretty mother.’ But when at last she&#10;really came, I shot her.”&#10;&#10;He moved slowly away.&#10;&#10;“Don’t go,” they called in pity.&#10;&#10;“I must,” he answered, shaking; “I am so afraid of Peter.”&#10;&#10;It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the&#10;heart of every one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow.&#10;&#10;“Peter!” they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled his&#10;return.&#10;&#10;“Hide her,” they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. But&#10;Tootles stood aloof.&#10;&#10;Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.&#10;“Greetings, boys,” he cried, and mechanically they saluted, and then&#10;again was silence.&#10;&#10;He frowned.&#10;&#10;“I am back,” he said hotly, “why do you not cheer?”&#10;&#10;They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked&#10;it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings.&#10;&#10;“Great news, boys,” he cried, “I have brought at last a mother for you&#10;all.”&#10;&#10;Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his&#10;knees.&#10;&#10;“Have you not seen her?” asked Peter, becoming troubled. “She flew this&#10;way.”&#10;&#10;“Ah me!” one voice said, and another said, “Oh, mournful day.”&#10;&#10;Tootles rose. “Peter,” he said quietly, “I will show her to you,” and&#10;when the others would still have hidden her he said, “Back, twins, let&#10;Peter see.”&#10;&#10;So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a&#10;little time he did not know what to do next.&#10;&#10;“She is dead,” he said uncomfortably. “Perhaps she is frightened at&#10;being dead.”&#10;&#10;He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of&#10;sight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. They would&#10;all have been glad to follow if he had done this.&#10;&#10;But there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band.&#10;&#10;“Whose arrow?” he demanded sternly.&#10;&#10;“Mine, Peter,” said Tootles on his knees.&#10;&#10;“Oh, dastard hand,” Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use it as a&#10;dagger.&#10;&#10;Tootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. “Strike, Peter,” he said&#10;firmly, “strike true.”&#10;&#10;Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. “I cannot&#10;strike,” he said with awe, “there is something stays my hand.”&#10;&#10;All looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at&#10;Wendy.&#10;&#10;“It is she,” he cried, “the Wendy lady, see, her arm!”&#10;&#10;Wonderful to relate, Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over her and&#10;listened reverently. “I think she said, ‘Poor Tootles,’” he whispered.&#10;&#10;“She lives,” Peter said briefly.&#10;&#10;Slightly cried instantly, “The Wendy lady lives.”&#10;&#10;Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had&#10;put it on a chain that she wore round her neck.&#10;&#10;“See,” he said, “the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I gave&#10;her. It has saved her life.”&#10;&#10;“I remember kisses,” Slightly interposed quickly, “let me see it. Ay,&#10;that’s a kiss.”&#10;&#10;Peter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so&#10;that he could show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer&#10;yet, being still in a frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing&#10;note.&#10;&#10;“Listen to Tink,” said Curly, “she is crying because the Wendy lives.”&#10;&#10;Then they had to tell Peter of Tink’s crime, and almost never had they&#10;seen him look so stern.&#10;&#10;“Listen, Tinker Bell,” he cried, “I am your friend no more. Begone from&#10;me for ever.”&#10;&#10;She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not&#10;until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say,&#10;“Well, not for ever, but for a whole week.”&#10;&#10;Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh&#10;dear no, never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange,&#10;and Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed them.&#10;&#10;But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?&#10;&#10;“Let us carry her down into the house,” Curly suggested.&#10;&#10;“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is what one does with ladies.”&#10;&#10;“No, no,” Peter said, “you must not touch her. It would not be&#10;sufficiently respectful.”&#10;&#10;“That,” said Slightly, “is what I was thinking.”&#10;&#10;“But if she lies there,” Tootles said, “she will die.”&#10;&#10;“Ay, she will die,” Slightly admitted, “but there is no way out.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, there is,” cried Peter. “Let us build a little house round her.”&#10;&#10;They were all delighted. “Quick,” he ordered them, “bring me each of&#10;you the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp.”&#10;&#10;In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding.&#10;They skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and&#10;while they were at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they&#10;dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up,&#10;moved another step and slept again.&#10;&#10;“John, John,” Michael would cry, “wake up! Where is Nana, John, and&#10;mother?”&#10;&#10;And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, “It is true, we did fly.”&#10;&#10;You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.&#10;&#10;“Hullo, Peter,” they said.&#10;&#10;“Hullo,” replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them. He&#10;was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how&#10;large a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for&#10;chairs and a table. John and Michael watched him.&#10;&#10;“Is Wendy asleep?” they asked.&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;“John,” Michael proposed, “let us wake her and get her to make supper&#10;for us,” but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying&#10;branches for the building of the house. “Look at them!” he cried.&#10;&#10;“Curly,” said Peter in his most captainy voice, “see that these boys&#10;help in the building of the house.”&#10;&#10;“Ay, ay, sir.”&#10;&#10;“Build a house?” exclaimed John.&#10;&#10;“For the Wendy,” said Curly.&#10;&#10;“For Wendy?” John said, aghast. “Why, she is only a girl!”&#10;&#10;“That,” explained Curly, “is why we are her servants.”&#10;&#10;“You? Wendy’s servants!”&#10;&#10;“Yes,” said Peter, “and you also. Away with them.”&#10;&#10;The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.&#10;“Chairs and a fender first,” Peter ordered. “Then we shall build a&#10;house round them.”&#10;&#10;“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is how a house is built; it all comes back&#10;to me.”&#10;&#10;Peter thought of everything. “Slightly,” he cried, “fetch a doctor.”&#10;&#10;“Ay, ay,” said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his head.&#10;But he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearing&#10;John’s hat and looking solemn.&#10;&#10;“Please, sir,” said Peter, going to him, “are you a doctor?”&#10;&#10;The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that&#10;they knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were&#10;exactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had&#10;to make-believe that they had had their dinners.&#10;&#10;If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the&#10;knuckles.&#10;&#10;“Yes, my little man,” Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped&#10;knuckles.&#10;&#10;“Please, sir,” Peter explained, “a lady lies very ill.”&#10;&#10;She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.&#10;&#10;“Tut, tut, tut,” he said, “where does she lie?”&#10;&#10;“In yonder glade.”&#10;&#10;“I will put a glass thing in her mouth,” said Slightly, and he&#10;made-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment&#10;when the glass thing was withdrawn.&#10;&#10;“How is she?” inquired Peter.&#10;&#10;“Tut, tut, tut,” said Slightly, “this has cured her.”&#10;&#10;“I am glad!” Peter cried.&#10;&#10;“I will call again in the evening,” Slightly said; “give her beef tea&#10;out of a cup with a spout to it;” but after he had returned the hat to&#10;John he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from a&#10;difficulty.&#10;&#10;In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost&#10;everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy’s feet.&#10;&#10;“If only we knew,” said one, “the kind of house she likes best.”&#10;&#10;“Peter,” shouted another, “she is moving in her sleep.”&#10;&#10;“Her mouth opens,” cried a third, looking respectfully into it. “Oh,&#10;lovely!”&#10;&#10;“Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep,” said Peter. “Wendy, sing&#10;the kind of house you would like to have.”&#10;&#10;Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:&#10;&#10;“I wish I had a pretty house,&#10;    The littlest ever seen,&#10;With funny little red walls&#10;    And roof of mossy green.”&#10;&#10;They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the&#10;branches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground&#10;was carpeted with moss. As they rattled up the little house they broke&#10;into song themselves:&#10;&#10;“We’ve built the little walls and roof&#10;    And made a lovely door,&#10;So tell us, mother Wendy,&#10;    What are you wanting more?”&#10;&#10;To this she answered greedily:&#10;&#10;“Oh, really next I think I’ll have&#10;    Gay windows all about,&#10;With roses peeping in, you know,&#10;    And babies peeping out.”&#10;&#10;With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves&#10;were the blinds. But roses—?&#10;&#10;“Roses,” cried Peter sternly.&#10;&#10;Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.&#10;&#10;Babies?&#10;&#10;To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:&#10;&#10;“We’ve made the roses peeping out,&#10;    The babes are at the door,&#10;We cannot make ourselves, you know,&#10;    ’Cos we’ve been made before.”&#10;&#10;Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his&#10;own. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy&#10;within, though, of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode&#10;up and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle&#10;eyes. Just when it seemed absolutely finished:&#10;&#10;“There’s no knocker on the door,” he said.&#10;&#10;They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it&#10;made an excellent knocker.&#10;&#10;Absolutely finished now, they thought.&#10;&#10;Not of bit of it. “There’s no chimney,” Peter said; “we must have a&#10;chimney.”&#10;&#10;“It certainly does need a chimney,” said John importantly. This gave&#10;Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John’s head, knocked out the&#10;bottom, and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to&#10;have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke&#10;immediately began to come out of the hat.&#10;&#10;Now really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to&#10;knock.&#10;&#10;“All look your best,” Peter warned them; “first impressions are awfully&#10;important.”&#10;&#10;He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all&#10;too busy looking their best.&#10;&#10;He knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not&#10;a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a&#10;branch and openly sneering.&#10;&#10;What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a&#10;lady, what would she be like?&#10;&#10;The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off&#10;their hats.&#10;&#10;She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she&#10;would look.&#10;&#10;“Where am I?” she said.&#10;&#10;Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in. “Wendy lady,” he&#10;said rapidly, “for you we built this house.”&#10;&#10;“Oh, say you’re pleased,” cried Nibs.&#10;&#10;“Lovely, darling house,” Wendy said, and they were the very words they&#10;had hoped she would say.&#10;&#10;“And we are your children,” cried the twins.&#10;&#10;Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, “O&#10;Wendy lady, be our mother.”&#10;&#10;“Ought I?” Wendy said, all shining. “Of course it’s frightfully&#10;fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real&#10;experience.”&#10;&#10;“That doesn’t matter,” said Peter, as if he were the only person&#10;present who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew&#10;least. “What we need is just a nice motherly person.”&#10;&#10;“Oh dear!” Wendy said, “you see, I feel that is exactly what I am.”&#10;&#10;“It is, it is,” they all cried; “we saw it at once.”&#10;&#10;“Very well,” she said, “I will do my best. Come inside at once, you&#10;naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to&#10;bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.”&#10;&#10;In they went; I don’t know how there was room for them, but you can&#10;squeeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many&#10;joyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in&#10;the great bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that&#10;night in the little house, and Peter kept watch outside with drawn&#10;sword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves&#10;were on the prowl. The little house looked so cosy and safe in the&#10;darkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds, and the&#10;chimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a time&#10;he fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on&#10;their way home from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the&#10;fairy path at night they would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked&#10;Peter’s nose and passed on.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter VII.&#10;THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND&#10;&#10;&#10;One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and&#10;John and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at&#10;the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was&#10;ignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up&#10;and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you&#10;fitted, you drew in your breath at the top, and down you went at&#10;exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out&#10;alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the&#10;action you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and&#10;nothing can be more graceful.&#10;&#10;But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as&#10;carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the&#10;clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.&#10;Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments&#10;or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only&#10;available tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and&#10;after that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on&#10;fitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a&#10;whole family in perfect condition.&#10;&#10;Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to&#10;be altered a little.&#10;&#10;After a few days’ practice they could go up and down as gaily as&#10;buckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under&#10;the ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all&#10;houses should do, with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to&#10;go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming&#10;colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in&#10;the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through,&#10;level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high,&#10;and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table;&#10;as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus&#10;there was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was&#10;in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across&#10;this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended&#10;her washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down&#10;at 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in&#10;it, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict&#10;rule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned&#10;at once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have a baby,&#10;and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and&#10;long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.&#10;&#10;It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made&#10;of an underground house in the same circumstances. But there was one&#10;recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private&#10;apartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of the&#10;house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious, always&#10;kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could&#10;have had a more exquisite boudoir and bed-chamber combined. The couch,&#10;as she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and&#10;she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in&#10;season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only&#10;three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust&#10;and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth,&#10;and the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and&#10;Robin. There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the&#10;thing, but of course she lit the residence herself. Tink was very&#10;contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps&#10;inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited,&#10;having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.&#10;&#10;I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those&#10;rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole&#10;weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was&#10;never above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the&#10;pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she&#10;had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never&#10;exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe,&#10;it all depended upon Peter’s whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was&#10;part of a game, but he could not stodge just to feel stodgy, which is&#10;what most children like better than anything else; the next best thing&#10;being to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during a&#10;meal of it you could see him getting rounder. Of course it was trying,&#10;but you simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him&#10;that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge.&#10;&#10;Wendy’s favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all&#10;gone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for&#10;herself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting&#10;double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on&#10;their knees.&#10;&#10;When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a&#10;hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, “Oh dear, I am&#10;sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!”&#10;&#10;Her face beamed when she exclaimed this.&#10;&#10;You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she&#10;had come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into&#10;each other’s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.&#10;&#10;As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had&#10;left behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite&#10;impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is&#10;calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them&#10;than on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry&#10;about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they&#10;would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave&#10;her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John&#10;remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while&#10;Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.&#10;These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she&#10;tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination&#10;papers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.&#10;The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on&#10;joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table,&#10;writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on&#10;another slate and passed round. They were the most ordinary&#10;questions—“What was the colour of Mother’s eyes? Which was taller,&#10;Father or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all three&#10;questions if possible.” “(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words&#10;on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother&#10;compared. Only one of these to be attempted.” Or “(1) Describe Mother’s&#10;laugh; (2) Describe Father’s laugh; (3) Describe Mother’s Party Dress;&#10;(4) Describe the Kennel and its Inmate.”&#10;&#10;They were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not&#10;answer them you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful&#10;what a number of crosses even John made. Of course the only boy who&#10;replied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more&#10;hopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous,&#10;and he really came out last: a melancholy thing.&#10;&#10;Peter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except&#10;Wendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could&#10;neither write nor spell; not the smallest word. He was above all that&#10;sort of thing.&#10;&#10;By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What was&#10;the colour of Mother’s eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been&#10;forgetting, too.&#10;&#10;Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but&#10;about this time Peter invented, with Wendy’s help, a new game that&#10;fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in&#10;it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his&#10;games. It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the&#10;sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting&#10;on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for&#10;walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To&#10;see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help&#10;looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic&#10;thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his&#10;health. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to&#10;him; and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also;&#10;otherwise he would have treated them severely.&#10;&#10;He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never&#10;absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might&#10;have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then&#10;when you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might&#10;say a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the body.&#10;Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed&#10;over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling&#10;tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however, many&#10;adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself,&#10;and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other&#10;boys were in them and said they were wholly true. To describe them all&#10;would require a book as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English&#10;Dictionary, and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an&#10;average hour on the island. The difficulty is which one to choose.&#10;Should we take the brush with the redskins at Slightly Gulch? It was a&#10;sanguinary affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter’s&#10;peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he would&#10;suddenly change sides. At the Gulch, when victory was still in the&#10;balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out,&#10;“I’m redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?” And Tootles answered,&#10;“Redskin; what are you, Nibs?” and Nibs said, “Redskin; what are you&#10;Twin?” and so on; and they were all redskins; and of course this would&#10;have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by Peter’s&#10;methods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at it they all&#10;went again, more fiercely than ever.&#10;&#10;The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was—but we have not decided&#10;yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one&#10;would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the&#10;ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be&#10;pulled out like corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily’s&#10;life in the Mermaids’ Lagoon, and so made her his ally.&#10;&#10;Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might&#10;eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after&#10;another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children,&#10;so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone,&#10;and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.&#10;&#10;Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter’s friends, particularly&#10;of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how&#10;the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and&#10;Peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty&#10;story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell it&#10;we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of&#10;course be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter&#10;adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell’s attempt, with the&#10;help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a&#10;great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and&#10;Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we&#10;might choose Peter’s defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round&#10;him on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though&#10;he waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on&#10;breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.&#10;&#10;Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss&#10;for it.&#10;&#10;I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that&#10;the gulch or the cake or Tink’s leaf had won. Of course I could do it&#10;again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick&#10;to the lagoon.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter VIII.&#10;THE MERMAIDS’ LAGOON&#10;&#10;&#10;If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a&#10;shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then&#10;if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and&#10;the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on&#10;fire. But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the&#10;nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment;&#10;if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the&#10;mermaids singing.&#10;&#10;The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or&#10;floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and&#10;so forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on&#10;friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy’s lasting&#10;regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil&#10;word from one of them. When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon&#10;she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners’ Rock, where&#10;they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite&#10;irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within&#10;a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her&#10;with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.&#10;&#10;They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who&#10;chatted with them on Marooners’ Rock by the hour, and sat on their&#10;tails when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.&#10;&#10;The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon,&#10;when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for&#10;mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy&#10;had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course&#10;Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules&#10;about every one being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon,&#10;however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in&#10;extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many&#10;colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily&#10;from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the&#10;rainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and&#10;the keepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of&#10;these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a&#10;pretty sight.&#10;&#10;But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by&#10;themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we&#10;have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not&#10;above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of&#10;hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids&#10;adopted it. This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.&#10;&#10;It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a&#10;rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on their&#10;doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was&#10;make-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened&#10;in it, while she sat beside them and looked important.&#10;&#10;It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners’ Rock. The rock was&#10;not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how&#10;not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with&#10;their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was&#10;not looking. She was very busy, stitching.&#10;&#10;While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over&#10;it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning&#10;it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she&#10;looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing&#10;place seemed formidable and unfriendly.&#10;&#10;It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as&#10;night had come. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent&#10;that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming. What was it?&#10;&#10;There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners’&#10;Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them&#10;there to drown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is&#10;submerged.&#10;&#10;Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely&#10;because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it&#10;was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she&#10;was a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply&#10;must stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So,&#10;though fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would&#10;not waken them. Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though&#10;her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She stood over them&#10;to let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?&#10;&#10;It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could&#10;sniff danger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at&#10;once as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the others.&#10;&#10;He stood motionless, one hand to his ear.&#10;&#10;“Pirates!” he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile was&#10;playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that&#10;smile was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was&#10;to stand ready to obey. The order came sharp and incisive.&#10;&#10;“Dive!”&#10;&#10;There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.&#10;Marooners’ Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were&#10;itself marooned.&#10;&#10;The boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in&#10;her, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger&#10;Lily. Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her&#10;fate. She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her&#10;race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written&#10;in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the&#10;happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter&#10;of a chief, she must die as a chief’s daughter, it is enough.&#10;&#10;They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth.&#10;No watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook’s boast that the wind of&#10;his name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to&#10;guard it also. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.&#10;&#10;In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see&#10;the rock till they crashed into it.&#10;&#10;“Luff, you lubber,” cried an Irish voice that was Smee’s; “here’s the&#10;rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it&#10;and leave her here to drown.”&#10;&#10;It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the&#10;rock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.&#10;&#10;Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and&#10;down, Peter’s and Wendy’s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first&#10;tragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had&#10;forgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was&#10;two against one that angered him, and he meant to save her. An easy way&#10;would have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he was never&#10;one to choose the easy way.&#10;&#10;There was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice&#10;of Hook.&#10;&#10;“Ahoy there, you lubbers!” he called. It was a marvellous imitation.&#10;&#10;“The captain!” said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.&#10;&#10;“He must be swimming out to us,” Starkey said, when they had looked for&#10;him in vain.&#10;&#10;“We are putting the redskin on the rock,” Smee called out.&#10;&#10;“Set her free,” came the astonishing answer.&#10;&#10;“Free!”&#10;&#10;“Yes, cut her bonds and let her go.”&#10;&#10;“But, captain—”&#10;&#10;“At once, d’ye hear,” cried Peter, “or I’ll plunge my hook in you.”&#10;&#10;“This is queer!” Smee gasped.&#10;&#10;“Better do what the captain orders,” said Starkey nervously.&#10;&#10;“Ay, ay,” Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily’s cords. At once like an eel&#10;she slid between Starkey’s legs into the water.&#10;&#10;Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter’s cleverness; but she knew&#10;that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray&#10;himself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was&#10;stayed even in the act, for “Boat ahoy!” rang over the lagoon in Hook’s&#10;voice, and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.&#10;&#10;Peter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle&#10;of surprise instead.&#10;&#10;“Boat ahoy!” again came the voice.&#10;&#10;Now Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.&#10;&#10;He was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him&#10;he had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his&#10;hook grip the boat’s side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose&#10;dripping from the water, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim&#10;away, but Peter would not budge. He was tingling with life and also&#10;top-heavy with conceit. “Am I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!” he&#10;whispered to her, and though she thought so also, she was really glad&#10;for the sake of his reputation that no one heard him except herself.&#10;&#10;He signed to her to listen.&#10;&#10;The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their&#10;captain to them, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of&#10;profound melancholy.&#10;&#10;“Captain, is all well?” they asked timidly, but he answered with a&#10;hollow moan.&#10;&#10;“He sighs,” said Smee.&#10;&#10;“He sighs again,” said Starkey.&#10;&#10;“And yet a third time he sighs,” said Smee.&#10;&#10;Then at last he spoke passionately.&#10;&#10;“The game’s up,” he cried, “those boys have found a mother.”&#10;&#10;Affrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.&#10;&#10;“O evil day!” cried Starkey.&#10;&#10;“What’s a mother?” asked the ignorant Smee.&#10;&#10;Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. “He doesn’t know!” and always&#10;after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would be&#10;her one.&#10;&#10;Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying,&#10;“What was that?”&#10;&#10;“I heard nothing,” said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters,&#10;and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I&#10;have told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was&#10;sitting on it.&#10;&#10;“See,” said Hook in answer to Smee’s question, “that is a mother. What&#10;a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the&#10;mother desert her eggs? No.”&#10;&#10;There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent&#10;days when—but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.&#10;&#10;Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but&#10;the more suspicious Starkey said, “If she is a mother, perhaps she is&#10;hanging about here to help Peter.”&#10;&#10;Hook winced. “Ay,” he said, “that is the fear that haunts me.”&#10;&#10;He was roused from this dejection by Smee’s eager voice.&#10;&#10;“Captain,” said Smee, “could we not kidnap these boys’ mother and make&#10;her our mother?”&#10;&#10;“It is a princely scheme,” cried Hook, and at once it took practical&#10;shape in his great brain. “We will seize the children and carry them to&#10;the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our&#10;mother.”&#10;&#10;Again Wendy forgot herself.&#10;&#10;“Never!” she cried, and bobbed.&#10;&#10;“What was that?”&#10;&#10;But they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in&#10;the wind. “Do you agree, my bullies?” asked Hook.&#10;&#10;“There is my hand on it,” they both said.&#10;&#10;“And there is my hook. Swear.”&#10;&#10;They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook&#10;remembered Tiger Lily.&#10;&#10;“Where is the redskin?” he demanded abruptly.&#10;&#10;He had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of&#10;the moments.&#10;&#10;“That is all right, captain,” Smee answered complacently; “we let her&#10;go.”&#10;&#10;“Let her go!” cried Hook.&#10;&#10;“’Twas your own orders,” the bo’sun faltered.&#10;&#10;“You called over the water to us to let her go,” said Starkey.&#10;&#10;“Brimstone and gall,” thundered Hook, “what cozening is going on here!”&#10;His face had gone black with rage, but he saw that they believed their&#10;words, and he was startled. “Lads,” he said, shaking a little, “I gave&#10;no such order.”&#10;&#10;“It is passing queer,” Smee said, and they all fidgeted uncomfortably.&#10;Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it.&#10;&#10;“Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,” he cried, “dost hear&#10;me?”&#10;&#10;Of course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not. He&#10;immediately answered in Hook’s voice:&#10;&#10;“Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.”&#10;&#10;In that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee&#10;and Starkey clung to each other in terror.&#10;&#10;“Who are you, stranger? Speak!” Hook demanded.&#10;&#10;“I am James Hook,” replied the voice, “captain of the _Jolly Roger_.”&#10;&#10;“You are not; you are not,” Hook cried hoarsely.&#10;&#10;“Brimstone and gall,” the voice retorted, “say that again, and I’ll&#10;cast anchor in you.”&#10;&#10;Hook tried a more ingratiating manner. “If you are Hook,” he said&#10;almost humbly, “come tell me, who am I?”&#10;&#10;“A codfish,” replied the voice, “only a codfish.”&#10;&#10;“A codfish!” Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not till then,&#10;that his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from him.&#10;&#10;“Have we been captained all this time by a codfish!” they muttered. “It&#10;is lowering to our pride.”&#10;&#10;They were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had&#10;become, he scarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was&#10;not their belief in him that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego&#10;slipping from him. “Don’t desert me, bully,” he whispered hoarsely to&#10;it.&#10;&#10;In his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the&#10;great pirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions. Suddenly he tried&#10;the guessing game.&#10;&#10;“Hook,” he called, “have you another voice?”&#10;&#10;Now Peter could never resist a game, and he answered blithely in his&#10;own voice, “I have.”&#10;&#10;“And another name?”&#10;&#10;“Ay, ay.”&#10;&#10;“Vegetable?” asked Hook.&#10;&#10;“No.”&#10;&#10;“Mineral?”&#10;&#10;“No.”&#10;&#10;“Animal?”&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;“Man?”&#10;&#10;“No!” This answer rang out scornfully.&#10;&#10;“Boy?”&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;“Ordinary boy?”&#10;&#10;“No!”&#10;&#10;“Wonderful boy?”&#10;&#10;To Wendy’s pain the answer that rang out this time was “Yes.”&#10;&#10;“Are you in England?”&#10;&#10;“No.”&#10;&#10;“Are you here?”&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;Hook was completely puzzled. “You ask him some questions,” he said to&#10;the others, wiping his damp brow.&#10;&#10;Smee reflected. “I can’t think of a thing,” he said regretfully.&#10;&#10;“Can’t guess, can’t guess!” crowed Peter. “Do you give it up?”&#10;&#10;Of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the&#10;miscreants saw their chance.&#10;&#10;“Yes, yes,” they answered eagerly.&#10;&#10;“Well, then,” he cried, “I am Peter Pan.”&#10;&#10;Pan!&#10;&#10;In a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his&#10;faithful henchmen.&#10;&#10;“Now we have him,” Hook shouted. “Into the water, Smee. Starkey, mind&#10;the boat. Take him dead or alive!”&#10;&#10;He leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter.&#10;&#10;“Are you ready, boys?”&#10;&#10;“Ay, ay,” from various parts of the lagoon.&#10;&#10;“Then lam into the pirates.”&#10;&#10;The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who&#10;gallantly climbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce&#10;struggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate’s grasp. He&#10;wriggled overboard and John leapt after him. The dinghy drifted away.&#10;&#10;Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of&#10;steel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at&#10;their own side. The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib,&#10;but he was himself pinked in turn by Curly. Farther from the rock&#10;Starkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard.&#10;&#10;Where all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.&#10;&#10;The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing&#10;from the pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water&#10;round him, from which they fled like affrighted fishes.&#10;&#10;But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter&#10;that circle.&#10;&#10;Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock&#10;to breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite&#10;side. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather&#10;than climb. Neither knew that the other was coming. Each feeling for a&#10;grip met the other’s arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their&#10;faces were almost touching; so they met.&#10;&#10;Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell&#10;to they had a sinking. Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would&#10;admit it. After all, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared.&#10;But Peter had no sinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he&#10;gnashed his pretty teeth with joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife&#10;from Hook’s belt and was about to drive it home, when he saw that he&#10;was higher up the rock than his foe. It would not have been fighting&#10;fair. He gave the pirate a hand to help him up.&#10;&#10;It was then that Hook bit him.&#10;&#10;Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made&#10;him quite helpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is&#10;affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he&#10;has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness. After you&#10;have been unfair to him he will love you again, but will never&#10;afterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets over the first&#10;unfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but he always forgot&#10;it. I suppose that was the real difference between him and all the&#10;rest.&#10;&#10;So when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just&#10;stare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.&#10;&#10;A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking&#10;wildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white&#10;fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary&#10;occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they&#10;were uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring&#10;the lagoon for them, calling them by name. They found the dinghy and&#10;went home in it, shouting “Peter, Wendy” as they went, but no answer&#10;came save mocking laughter from the mermaids. “They must be swimming&#10;back or flying,” the boys concluded. They were not very anxious,&#10;because they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled, boylike, because&#10;they would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy’s fault!&#10;&#10;When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon,&#10;and then a feeble cry.&#10;&#10;“Help, help!”&#10;&#10;Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted&#10;and lay on the boy’s arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the&#10;rock and then lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that&#10;the water was rising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he&#10;could do no more.&#10;&#10;As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began&#10;pulling her softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him,&#10;woke with a start, and was just in time to draw her back. But he had to&#10;tell her the truth.&#10;&#10;“We are on the rock, Wendy,” he said, “but it is growing smaller. Soon&#10;the water will be over it.”&#10;&#10;She did not understand even now.&#10;&#10;“We must go,” she said, almost brightly.&#10;&#10;“Yes,” he answered faintly.&#10;&#10;“Shall we swim or fly, Peter?”&#10;&#10;He had to tell her.&#10;&#10;“Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy,&#10;without my help?”&#10;&#10;She had to admit that she was too tired.&#10;&#10;He moaned.&#10;&#10;“What is it?” she asked, anxious about him at once.&#10;&#10;“I can’t help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor swim.”&#10;&#10;“Do you mean we shall both be drowned?”&#10;&#10;“Look how the water is rising.”&#10;&#10;They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They&#10;thought they would soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed&#10;against Peter as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying&#10;timidly, “Can I be of any use?”&#10;&#10;It was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It&#10;had torn itself out of his hand and floated away.&#10;&#10;“Michael’s kite,” Peter said without interest, but next moment he had&#10;seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.&#10;&#10;“It lifted Michael off the ground,” he cried; “why should it not carry&#10;you?”&#10;&#10;“Both of us!”&#10;&#10;“It can’t lift two; Michael and Curly tried.”&#10;&#10;“Let us draw lots,” Wendy said bravely.&#10;&#10;“And you a lady; never.” Already he had tied the tail round her. She&#10;clung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a “Good-bye,&#10;Wendy,” he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borne&#10;out of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon.&#10;&#10;The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of&#10;light tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a&#10;sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world:&#10;the mermaids calling to the moon.&#10;&#10;Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A&#10;tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on&#10;the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them,&#10;and Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the&#10;rock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him.&#10;It was saying, “To die will be an awfully big adventure.”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter IX.&#10;THE NEVER BIRD&#10;&#10;&#10;The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids&#10;retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far&#10;away to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where&#10;they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the&#10;nicest houses on the mainland), and he heard the bells.&#10;&#10;Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to&#10;pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only&#10;thing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating paper,&#10;perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to&#10;drift ashore.&#10;&#10;Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon&#10;the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide,&#10;and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to&#10;the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece&#10;of paper.&#10;&#10;It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making&#10;desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in&#10;a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able&#10;to some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter&#10;recognised her she was very exhausted. She had come to save him, to&#10;give him her nest, though there were eggs in it. I rather wonder at the&#10;bird, for though he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes&#10;tormented her. I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest&#10;of them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth.&#10;&#10;She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her&#10;what she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood the&#10;other’s language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds&#10;freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a&#10;story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but&#10;truth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened. Well,&#10;not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their&#10;manners.&#10;&#10;“I—want—you—to—get—into—the—nest,” the bird called, speaking as slowly&#10;and distinctly as possible, “and—then—you—can—drift—ashore,&#10;but—I—am—too—tired—to—bring—it—any—nearer—so—you—must—try&#10;to—swim—to—it.”&#10;&#10;“What are you quacking about?” Peter answered. “Why don’t you let the&#10;nest drift as usual?”&#10;&#10;“I—want—you—” the bird said, and repeated it all over.&#10;&#10;Then Peter tried slow and distinct.&#10;&#10;“What—are—you—quacking—about?” and so on.&#10;&#10;The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.&#10;&#10;“You dunderheaded little jay!” she screamed, “Why don’t you do as I&#10;tell you?”&#10;&#10;Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted&#10;hotly:&#10;&#10;“So are you!”&#10;&#10;Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:&#10;&#10;“Shut up!”&#10;&#10;“Shut up!”&#10;&#10;Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by&#10;one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up&#10;she flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.&#10;&#10;Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks&#10;to the bird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his&#10;thanks, however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to&#10;watch him get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.&#10;&#10;There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and&#10;reflected. The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see&#10;the last of them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.&#10;&#10;I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock,&#10;driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of&#10;buried treasure. The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and&#10;when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds,&#10;pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for&#10;food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been&#10;played upon them. The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung&#10;his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. Peter put the&#10;eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated beautifully.&#10;&#10;The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her&#10;admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then&#10;he got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his&#10;shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the&#10;hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs. She drifted in one direction,&#10;and he was borne off in another, both cheering.&#10;&#10;Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the&#10;bird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that&#10;she abandoned the nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and&#10;often Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter&#10;feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat. As we shall not see her&#10;again, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build&#10;in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take&#10;an airing.&#10;&#10;Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground&#10;almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the&#10;kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest&#10;adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so&#10;inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up&#10;still longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in&#10;having them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the&#10;lateness of the hour, and cried, “To bed, to bed,” in a voice that had&#10;to be obeyed. Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out&#10;bandages to every one, and they played till bed-time at limping about&#10;and carrying their arms in slings.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter X.&#10;THE HAPPY HOME&#10;&#10;&#10;One important result of the brush on the lagoon was that it made the&#10;redskins their friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful&#10;fate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for&#10;him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the&#10;ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could&#10;not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking the&#10;pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.&#10;&#10;They called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves before&#10;him; and he liked this tremendously, so that it was not really good for&#10;him.&#10;&#10;“The great white father,” he would say to them in a very lordly manner,&#10;as they grovelled at his feet, “is glad to see the Piccaninny warriors&#10;protecting his wigwam from the pirates.”&#10;&#10;“Me Tiger Lily,” that lovely creature would reply. “Peter Pan save me,&#10;me his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him.”&#10;&#10;She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his&#10;due, and he would answer condescendingly, “It is good. Peter Pan has&#10;spoken.”&#10;&#10;Always when he said, “Peter Pan has spoken,” it meant that they must&#10;now shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were&#10;by no means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as&#10;just ordinary braves. They said “How-do?” to them, and things like&#10;that; and what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all&#10;right.&#10;&#10;Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too&#10;loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father. “Father&#10;knows best,” she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her&#10;private opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.&#10;&#10;We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the&#10;Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day,&#10;as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now&#10;the redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below,&#10;the children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had&#10;gone out to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to&#10;find the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.&#10;&#10;The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the&#10;board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and&#10;recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening. To&#10;be sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them&#10;grabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles&#10;had pushed their elbow. There was a fixed rule that they must never hit&#10;back at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by&#10;raising the right arm politely and saying, “I complain of so-and-so;”&#10;but what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too&#10;much.&#10;&#10;“Silence,” cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them&#10;that they were not all to speak at once. “Is your mug empty, Slightly&#10;darling?”&#10;&#10;“Not quite empty, mummy,” Slightly said, after looking into an&#10;imaginary mug.&#10;&#10;“He hasn’t even begun to drink his milk,” Nibs interposed.&#10;&#10;This was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.&#10;&#10;“I complain of Nibs,” he cried promptly.&#10;&#10;John, however, had held up his hand first.&#10;&#10;“Well, John?”&#10;&#10;“May I sit in Peter’s chair, as he is not here?”&#10;&#10;“Sit in father’s chair, John!” Wendy was scandalised. “Certainly not.”&#10;&#10;“He is not really our father,” John answered. “He didn’t even know how&#10;a father does till I showed him.”&#10;&#10;This was grumbling. “We complain of John,” cried the twins.&#10;&#10;Tootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them, indeed&#10;he was the only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him.&#10;&#10;“I don’t suppose,” Tootles said diffidently, “that I could be father.”&#10;&#10;“No, Tootles.”&#10;&#10;Once Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way of&#10;going on.&#10;&#10;“As I can’t be father,” he said heavily, “I don’t suppose, Michael, you&#10;would let me be baby?”&#10;&#10;“No, I won’t,” Michael rapped out. He was already in his basket.&#10;&#10;“As I can’t be baby,” Tootles said, getting heavier and heavier and&#10;heavier, “do you think I could be a twin?”&#10;&#10;“No, indeed,” replied the twins; “it’s awfully difficult to be a twin.”&#10;&#10;“As I can’t be anything important,” said Tootles, “would any of you&#10;like to see me do a trick?”&#10;&#10;“No,” they all replied.&#10;&#10;Then at last he stopped. “I hadn’t really any hope,” he said.&#10;&#10;The hateful telling broke out again.&#10;&#10;“Slightly is coughing on the table.”&#10;&#10;“The twins began with cheese-cakes.”&#10;&#10;“Curly is taking both butter and honey.”&#10;&#10;“Nibs is speaking with his mouth full.”&#10;&#10;“I complain of the twins.”&#10;&#10;“I complain of Curly.”&#10;&#10;“I complain of Nibs.”&#10;&#10;“Oh dear, oh dear,” cried Wendy, “I’m sure I sometimes think that&#10;spinsters are to be envied.”&#10;&#10;She told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy&#10;load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual.&#10;&#10;“Wendy,” remonstrated Michael, “I’m too big for a cradle.”&#10;&#10;“I must have somebody in a cradle,” she said almost tartly, “and you&#10;are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a&#10;house.”&#10;&#10;While she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces and&#10;dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very&#10;familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking&#10;on it for the last time.&#10;&#10;There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to&#10;recognize it.&#10;&#10;“Children, I hear your father’s step. He likes you to meet him at the&#10;door.”&#10;&#10;Above, the redskins crouched before Peter.&#10;&#10;“Watch well, braves. I have spoken.”&#10;&#10;And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his&#10;tree. As so often before, but never again.&#10;&#10;He had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy.&#10;&#10;“Peter, you just spoil them, you know,” Wendy simpered.&#10;&#10;“Ah, old lady,” said Peter, hanging up his gun.&#10;&#10;“It was me told him mothers are called old lady,” Michael whispered to&#10;Curly.&#10;&#10;“I complain of Michael,” said Curly instantly.&#10;&#10;The first twin came to Peter. “Father, we want to dance.”&#10;&#10;“Dance away, my little man,” said Peter, who was in high good humour.&#10;&#10;“But we want you to dance.”&#10;&#10;Peter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to be&#10;scandalised.&#10;&#10;“Me! My old bones would rattle!”&#10;&#10;“And mummy too.”&#10;&#10;“What,” cried Wendy, “the mother of such an armful, dance!”&#10;&#10;“But on a Saturday night,” Slightly insinuated.&#10;&#10;It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they&#10;had long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do&#10;anything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did&#10;it.&#10;&#10;“Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,” Wendy said, relenting.&#10;&#10;“People of our figure, Wendy!”&#10;&#10;“But it is only among our own progeny.”&#10;&#10;“True, true.”&#10;&#10;So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties&#10;first.&#10;&#10;“Ah, old lady,” Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire&#10;and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, “there is nothing&#10;more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day’s toil is over&#10;than to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.”&#10;&#10;“It is sweet, Peter, isn’t it?” Wendy said, frightfully gratified.&#10;“Peter, I think Curly has your nose.”&#10;&#10;“Michael takes after you.”&#10;&#10;She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.&#10;&#10;“Dear Peter,” she said, “with such a large family, of course, I have&#10;now passed my best, but you don’t want to change me, do you?”&#10;&#10;“No, Wendy.”&#10;&#10;Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably,&#10;blinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.&#10;&#10;“Peter, what is it?”&#10;&#10;“I was just thinking,” he said, a little scared. “It is only&#10;make-believe, isn’t it, that I am their father?”&#10;&#10;“Oh yes,” Wendy said primly.&#10;&#10;“You see,” he continued apologetically, “it would make me seem so old&#10;to be their real father.”&#10;&#10;“But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.”&#10;&#10;“But not really, Wendy?” he asked anxiously.&#10;&#10;“Not if you don’t wish it,” she replied; and she distinctly heard his&#10;sigh of relief. “Peter,” she asked, trying to speak firmly, “what are&#10;your exact feelings to me?”&#10;&#10;“Those of a devoted son, Wendy.”&#10;&#10;“I thought so,” she said, and went and sat by herself at the extreme&#10;end of the room.&#10;&#10;“You are so queer,” he said, frankly puzzled, “and Tiger Lily is just&#10;the same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it is&#10;not my mother.”&#10;&#10;“No, indeed, it is not,” Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. Now we&#10;know why she was prejudiced against the redskins.&#10;&#10;“Then what is it?”&#10;&#10;“It isn’t for a lady to tell.”&#10;&#10;“Oh, very well,” Peter said, a little nettled. “Perhaps Tinker Bell&#10;will tell me.”&#10;&#10;“Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,” Wendy retorted scornfully. “She is&#10;an abandoned little creature.”&#10;&#10;Here Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out&#10;something impudent.&#10;&#10;“She says she glories in being abandoned,” Peter interpreted.&#10;&#10;He had a sudden idea. “Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?”&#10;&#10;“You silly ass!” cried Tinker Bell in a passion.&#10;&#10;She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.&#10;&#10;“I almost agree with her,” Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But she&#10;had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the&#10;night was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.&#10;&#10;None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance&#10;gave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on&#10;the island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it.&#10;They sang and danced in their night-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy&#10;song it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own&#10;shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them,&#10;from whom they would shrink in real fear. So uproariously gay was the&#10;dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! It&#10;was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the&#10;pillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may&#10;never meet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy’s&#10;good-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but&#10;the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the&#10;others but himself, and he said gloomily:&#10;&#10;“Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the&#10;end.”&#10;&#10;And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy’s story, the story&#10;they loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell&#10;this story he left the room or put his hands over his ears; and&#10;possibly if he had done either of those things this time they might all&#10;still be on the island. But to-night he remained on his stool; and we&#10;shall see what happened.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter XI.&#10;WENDY’S STORY&#10;&#10;&#10;“Listen, then,” said Wendy, settling down to her story, with Michael at&#10;her feet and seven boys in the bed. “There was once a gentleman—”&#10;&#10;“I had rather he had been a lady,” Curly said.&#10;&#10;“I wish he had been a white rat,” said Nibs.&#10;&#10;“Quiet,” their mother admonished them. “There was a lady also, and—”&#10;&#10;“Oh, mummy,” cried the first twin, “you mean that there is a lady also,&#10;don’t you? She is not dead, is she?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, no.”&#10;&#10;“I am awfully glad she isn’t dead,” said Tootles. “Are you glad, John?”&#10;&#10;“Of course I am.”&#10;&#10;“Are you glad, Nibs?”&#10;&#10;“Rather.”&#10;&#10;“Are you glad, Twins?”&#10;&#10;“We are glad.”&#10;&#10;“Oh dear,” sighed Wendy.&#10;&#10;“Little less noise there,” Peter called out, determined that she should&#10;have fair play, however beastly a story it might be in his opinion.&#10;&#10;“The gentleman’s name,” Wendy continued, “was Mr. Darling, and her name&#10;was Mrs. Darling.”&#10;&#10;“I knew them,” John said, to annoy the others.&#10;&#10;“I think I knew them,” said Michael rather doubtfully.&#10;&#10;“They were married, you know,” explained Wendy, “and what do you think&#10;they had?”&#10;&#10;“White rats,” cried Nibs, inspired.&#10;&#10;“No.”&#10;&#10;“It’s awfully puzzling,” said Tootles, who knew the story by heart.&#10;&#10;“Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants.”&#10;&#10;“What is descendants?”&#10;&#10;“Well, you are one, Twin.”&#10;&#10;“Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant.”&#10;&#10;“Descendants are only children,” said John.&#10;&#10;“Oh dear, oh dear,” sighed Wendy. “Now these three children had a&#10;faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and&#10;chained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.”&#10;&#10;“It’s an awfully good story,” said Nibs.&#10;&#10;“They flew away,” Wendy continued, “to the Neverland, where the lost&#10;children are.”&#10;&#10;“I just thought they did,” Curly broke in excitedly. “I don’t know how&#10;it is, but I just thought they did!”&#10;&#10;“O Wendy,” cried Tootles, “was one of the lost children called&#10;Tootles?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, he was.”&#10;&#10;“I am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs.”&#10;&#10;“Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents&#10;with all their children flown away.”&#10;&#10;“Oo!” they all moaned, though they were not really considering the&#10;feelings of the unhappy parents one jot.&#10;&#10;“Think of the empty beds!”&#10;&#10;“Oo!”&#10;&#10;“It’s awfully sad,” the first twin said cheerfully.&#10;&#10;“I don’t see how it can have a happy ending,” said the second twin. “Do&#10;you, Nibs?”&#10;&#10;“I’m frightfully anxious.”&#10;&#10;“If you knew how great is a mother’s love,” Wendy told them&#10;triumphantly, “you would have no fear.” She had now come to the part&#10;that Peter hated.&#10;&#10;“I do like a mother’s love,” said Tootles, hitting Nibs with a pillow.&#10;“Do you like a mother’s love, Nibs?”&#10;&#10;“I do just,” said Nibs, hitting back.&#10;&#10;“You see,” Wendy said complacently, “our heroine knew that the mother&#10;would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by; so&#10;they stayed away for years and had a lovely time.”&#10;&#10;“Did they ever go back?”&#10;&#10;“Let us now,” said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest effort,&#10;“take a peep into the future;” and they all gave themselves the twist&#10;that makes peeps into the future easier. “Years have rolled by, and who&#10;is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?”&#10;&#10;“O Wendy, who is she?” cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if he didn’t&#10;know.&#10;&#10;“Can it be—yes—no—it is—the fair Wendy!”&#10;&#10;“Oh!”&#10;&#10;“And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown&#10;to man’s estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!”&#10;&#10;“Oh!”&#10;&#10;“‘See, dear brothers,’ says Wendy pointing upwards, ‘there is the&#10;window still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our sublime&#10;faith in a mother’s love.’ So up they flew to their mummy and daddy,&#10;and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we draw a veil.”&#10;&#10;That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair&#10;narrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip&#10;like the most heartless things in the world, which is what children&#10;are, but so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish time, and then&#10;when we have need of special attention we nobly return for it,&#10;confident that we shall be rewarded instead of smacked.&#10;&#10;So great indeed was their faith in a mother’s love that they felt they&#10;could afford to be callous for a bit longer.&#10;&#10;But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he&#10;uttered a hollow groan.&#10;&#10;“What is it, Peter?” she cried, running to him, thinking he was ill.&#10;She felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. “Where is it,&#10;Peter?”&#10;&#10;“It isn’t that kind of pain,” Peter replied darkly.&#10;&#10;“Then what kind is it?”&#10;&#10;“Wendy, you are wrong about mothers.”&#10;&#10;They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation;&#10;and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.&#10;&#10;“Long ago,” he said, “I thought like you that my mother would always&#10;keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and&#10;moons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had&#10;forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my&#10;bed.”&#10;&#10;I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it&#10;scared them.&#10;&#10;“Are you sure mothers are like that?”&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;So this was the truth about mothers. The toads!&#10;&#10;Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child&#10;when he should give in. “Wendy, let us go home,” cried John and Michael&#10;together.&#10;&#10;“Yes,” she said, clutching them.&#10;&#10;“Not to-night?” asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in what they&#10;called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother,&#10;and that it is only the mothers who think you can’t.&#10;&#10;“At once,” Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come&#10;to her: “Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.”&#10;&#10;This dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter’s feelings, and she&#10;said to him rather sharply, “Peter, will you make the necessary&#10;arrangements?”&#10;&#10;“If you wish it,” he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him to pass&#10;the nuts.&#10;&#10;Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind&#10;the parting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he.&#10;&#10;But of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath against&#10;grown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he&#10;got inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at&#10;the rate of about five to a second. He did this because there is a&#10;saying in the Neverland that, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies;&#10;and Peter was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible.&#10;&#10;Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he&#10;returned to the home, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his&#10;absence. Panic-stricken at the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys&#10;had advanced upon her threateningly.&#10;&#10;“It will be worse than before she came,” they cried.&#10;&#10;“We shan’t let her go.”&#10;&#10;“Let’s keep her prisoner.”&#10;&#10;“Ay, chain her up.”&#10;&#10;In her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn.&#10;&#10;“Tootles,” she cried, “I appeal to you.”&#10;&#10;Was it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.&#10;&#10;Grandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped&#10;his silliness and spoke with dignity.&#10;&#10;“I am just Tootles,” he said, “and nobody minds me. But the first who&#10;does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him&#10;severely.”&#10;&#10;He drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The&#10;others held back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once&#10;that they would get no support from him. He would keep no girl in the&#10;Neverland against her will.&#10;&#10;“Wendy,” he said, striding up and down, “I have asked the redskins to&#10;guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.”&#10;&#10;“Thank you, Peter.”&#10;&#10;“Then,” he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be&#10;obeyed, “Tinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her, Nibs.”&#10;&#10;Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really&#10;been sitting up in bed listening for some time.&#10;&#10;“Who are you? How dare you? Go away,” she cried.&#10;&#10;“You are to get up, Tink,” Nibs called, “and take Wendy on a journey.”&#10;&#10;Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she&#10;was jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in&#10;still more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.&#10;&#10;“She says she won’t!” Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination,&#10;whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady’s chamber.&#10;&#10;“Tink,” he rapped out, “if you don’t get up and dress at once I will&#10;open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your _negligée_.”&#10;&#10;This made her leap to the floor. “Who said I wasn’t getting up?” she&#10;cried.&#10;&#10;In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now&#10;equipped with John and Michael for the journey. By this time they were&#10;dejected, not merely because they were about to lose her, but also&#10;because they felt that she was going off to something nice to which&#10;they had not been invited. Novelty was beckoning to them as usual.&#10;&#10;Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.&#10;&#10;“Dear ones,” she said, “if you will all come with me I feel almost sure&#10;I can get my father and mother to adopt you.”&#10;&#10;The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was&#10;thinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.&#10;&#10;“But won’t they think us rather a handful?” Nibs asked in the middle of&#10;his jump.&#10;&#10;“Oh no,” said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, “it will only mean having&#10;a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the screens&#10;on first Thursdays.”&#10;&#10;“Peter, can we go?” they all cried imploringly. They took it for&#10;granted that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely&#10;cared. Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert&#10;their dearest ones.&#10;&#10;“All right,” Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately they&#10;rushed to get their things.&#10;&#10;“And now, Peter,” Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right, “I&#10;am going to give you your medicine before you go.” She loved to give&#10;them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was&#10;only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle&#10;and counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On&#10;this occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught, for just as&#10;she had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her heart&#10;sink.&#10;&#10;“Get your things, Peter,” she cried, shaking.&#10;&#10;“No,” he answered, pretending indifference, “I am not going with you,&#10;Wendy.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, Peter.”&#10;&#10;“No.”&#10;&#10;To show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and&#10;down the room, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run&#10;about after him, though it was rather undignified.&#10;&#10;“To find your mother,” she coaxed.&#10;&#10;Now, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He&#10;could do very well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered&#10;only their bad points.&#10;&#10;“No, no,” he told Wendy decisively; “perhaps she would say I was old,&#10;and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.”&#10;&#10;“But, Peter—”&#10;&#10;“No.”&#10;&#10;And so the others had to be told.&#10;&#10;“Peter isn’t coming.”&#10;&#10;Peter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their&#10;backs, and on each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if&#10;Peter was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them&#10;go.&#10;&#10;But he was far too proud for that. “If you find your mothers,” he said&#10;darkly, “I hope you will like them.”&#10;&#10;The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most&#10;of them began to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said,&#10;were they not noodles to want to go?&#10;&#10;“Now then,” cried Peter, “no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy;” and&#10;he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for&#10;he had something important to do.&#10;&#10;She had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would&#10;prefer a thimble.&#10;&#10;“You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?” she said,&#10;lingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels.&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;“And you will take your medicine?”&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter,&#10;however, was not the kind that breaks down before other people. “Are&#10;you ready, Tinker Bell?” he called out.&#10;&#10;“Ay, ay.”&#10;&#10;“Then lead the way.”&#10;&#10;Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was at&#10;this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the&#10;redskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with&#10;shrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths&#10;opened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were&#10;extended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly&#10;blown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely not to desert&#10;them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he thought he had&#10;slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter XII.&#10;THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF&#10;&#10;&#10;The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the&#10;unscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins&#10;fairly is beyond the wit of the white man.&#10;&#10;By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin&#10;who attacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before&#10;the dawn, at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its&#10;lowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on&#10;the summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream&#10;runs, for it is destruction to be too far from water. There they await&#10;the onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and&#10;treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just&#10;before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts&#10;wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The&#10;brushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has&#10;dived. Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a&#10;wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is&#10;answered by other braves; and some of them do it even better than the&#10;coyotes, who are not very good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and&#10;the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live&#10;through it for the first time; but to the trained hand those ghastly&#10;calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the&#10;night is marching.&#10;&#10;That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in&#10;disregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.&#10;&#10;The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and&#10;their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his.&#10;They left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of&#10;their tribe. With that alertness of the senses which is at once the&#10;marvel and despair of civilised peoples, they knew that the pirates&#10;were on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick; and&#10;in an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began. Every foot&#10;of ground between the spot where Hook had landed his forces and the&#10;home under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their&#10;mocassins with the heels in front. They found only one hillock with a&#10;stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must establish&#10;himself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped&#10;out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins&#10;folded their blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is&#10;to them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children’s home,&#10;awaiting the cold moment when they should deal pale death.&#10;&#10;Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which&#10;they were to put him at break of day, those confiding savages were&#10;found by the treacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by&#10;such of the scouts as escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to&#10;have paused at the rising ground, though it is certain that in that&#10;grey light he must have seen it: no thought of waiting to be attacked&#10;appears from first to last to have visited his subtle mind; he would&#10;not even hold off till the night was nearly spent; on he pounded with&#10;no policy but to fall to. What could the bewildered scouts do, masters&#10;as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot&#10;helplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they&#10;gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry.&#10;&#10;Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and&#10;they suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell&#10;from their eyes then the film through which they had looked at victory.&#10;No more would they torture at the stake. For them the happy&#10;hunting-grounds was now. They knew it; but as their father’s sons they&#10;acquitted themselves. Even then they had time to gather in a phalanx&#10;that would have been hard to break had they risen quickly, but this&#10;they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. It is&#10;written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the&#10;presence of the white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the&#10;pirates must have been to them, they remained stationary for a moment,&#10;not a muscle moving; as if the foe had come by invitation. Then,&#10;indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and&#10;the air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too late.&#10;&#10;It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a&#10;fight. Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not&#10;all unavenged did they die, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to&#10;disturb the Spanish Main no more, and among others who bit the dust&#10;were Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the Alsatian Foggerty. Turley fell&#10;to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who ultimately cut a way&#10;through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe.&#10;&#10;To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for&#10;the historian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the&#10;proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered; and in&#10;judging him it is only fair to take this into account. What he should&#10;perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to&#10;follow a new method. On the other hand, this, as destroying the element&#10;of surprise, would have made his strategy of no avail, so that the&#10;whole question is beset with difficulties. One cannot at least withhold&#10;a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme,&#10;and the fell genius with which it was carried out.&#10;&#10;What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment?&#10;Fain would his dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their&#10;cutlasses, they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and&#10;squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation&#10;must have been in his heart, but his face did not reflect it: ever a&#10;dark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof from his followers in spirit&#10;as in substance.&#10;&#10;The night’s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had&#10;come out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he&#10;should get at the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their&#10;band, but chiefly Pan.&#10;&#10;Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man’s hatred&#10;of him. True he had flung Hook’s arm to the crocodile, but even this&#10;and the increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to the&#10;crocodile’s pertinacity, hardly account for a vindictiveness so&#10;relentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about&#10;Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his&#10;courage, it was not his engaging appearance, it was not—. There is no&#10;beating about the bush, for we know quite well what it was, and have&#10;got to tell. It was Peter’s cockiness.&#10;&#10;This had got on Hook’s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at&#10;night it disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured&#10;man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.&#10;&#10;The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs&#10;down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest&#10;ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple&#10;to ram them down with poles.&#10;&#10;In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang&#10;of the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all&#10;appealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as&#10;their mouths close, and their arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium&#10;above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce&#10;gust of wind; but they know that in the passing it has determined their&#10;fate.&#10;&#10;Which side had won?&#10;&#10;The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the&#10;question put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter’s answer.&#10;&#10;“If the redskins have won,” he said, “they will beat the tom-tom; it is&#10;always their sign of victory.”&#10;&#10;Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.&#10;“You will never hear the tom-tom again,” he muttered, but inaudibly of&#10;course, for strict silence had been enjoined. To his amazement Hook&#10;signed him to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an&#10;understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably,&#10;had this simple man admired Hook so much.&#10;&#10;Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen&#10;gleefully.&#10;&#10;“The tom-tom,” the miscreants heard Peter cry; “an Indian victory!”&#10;&#10;The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black&#10;hearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to&#10;Peter. This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were&#10;swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the&#10;trees. They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and&#10;silently Hook gave his orders: one man to each tree, and the others to&#10;arrange themselves in a line two yards apart.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter XIII.&#10;DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?&#10;&#10;&#10;The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to&#10;emerge from his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of&#10;Cecco, who flung him to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him&#10;to Bill Jukes, who flung him to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one&#10;to another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate. All the boys&#10;were plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner; and several of&#10;them were in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to&#10;hand.&#10;&#10;A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With&#10;ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his&#10;arm, escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged. He&#10;did it with such an air, he was so frightfully _distingué_, that she&#10;was too fascinated to cry out. She was only a little girl.&#10;&#10;Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced&#10;her, and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results.&#10;Had she haughtily unhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of&#10;her), she would have been hurled through the air like the others, and&#10;then Hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the&#10;children; and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered&#10;Slightly’s secret, and without the secret he could not presently have&#10;made his foul attempt on Peter’s life.&#10;&#10;They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their&#10;knees close to their ears; and for the trussing of them the black&#10;pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well until&#10;Slightly’s turn came, when he was found to be like those irritating&#10;parcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags&#10;with which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked him in their rage, just as&#10;you kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kick the string);&#10;and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence.&#10;His lip was curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely&#10;sweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in&#10;one part he bulged out in another, Hook’s master mind had gone far&#10;beneath Slightly’s surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and&#10;his exultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the&#10;gills, knew that Hook had surprised his secret, which was this, that no&#10;boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick.&#10;Poor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he was in a&#10;panic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he had done. Madly addicted&#10;to the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in consequence&#10;to his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit his tree&#10;he had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit him.&#10;&#10;Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay&#10;at his mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the&#10;subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed&#10;that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be&#10;alone.&#10;&#10;How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be&#10;rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a&#10;morass. Again Hook’s genius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that&#10;the little house must be used as a conveyance. The children were flung&#10;into it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others&#10;fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange&#10;procession set off through the wood. I don’t know whether any of the&#10;children were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound; but as the&#10;little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of&#10;smoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook.&#10;&#10;Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of&#10;pity for him that may have remained in the pirate’s infuriated breast.&#10;&#10;The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling&#10;night was to tiptoe to Slightly’s tree, and make sure that it provided&#10;him with a passage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill&#10;omen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might&#10;play refreshingly through his hair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue&#10;eyes were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently he listened for any sound&#10;from the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house&#10;under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void.&#10;Was that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly’s&#10;tree, with his dagger in his hand?&#10;&#10;There was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak&#10;slip softly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood&#10;stood on them, he stepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a&#10;moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like&#10;a candle. Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.&#10;&#10;He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again,&#10;biting at his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became&#10;accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees&#10;took shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long&#10;sought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay Peter&#10;fast asleep.&#10;&#10;Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a&#10;little time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no&#10;doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not&#10;care. Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy.&#10;Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still&#10;more; for she had always tucked them inside it, because you never know&#10;that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly&#10;cried; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed&#10;instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of&#10;it.&#10;&#10;Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful&#10;than the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from&#10;these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I&#10;think, with the riddle of his existence. At such times it had been&#10;Wendy’s custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap,&#10;soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer&#10;to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should not&#10;know of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this&#10;occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped&#10;over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part&#10;of his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the&#10;little pearls.&#10;&#10;Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the&#10;tree looking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of&#10;compassion disturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he&#10;loved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no&#10;mean performer on the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted,&#10;the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly. Mastered by his&#10;better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one&#10;thing.&#10;&#10;What stayed him was Peter’s impertinent appearance as he slept. The&#10;open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a&#10;personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one&#10;may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness.&#10;They steeled Hook’s heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred&#10;pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt&#10;at the sleeper.&#10;&#10;Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in&#10;darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered&#10;an obstacle, the door of Slightly’s tree. It did not entirely fill the&#10;aperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he&#10;found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his&#10;disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter’s&#10;face and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung&#10;himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?&#10;&#10;But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter’s&#10;medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was&#10;straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.&#10;&#10;Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a&#10;dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that&#10;had come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow&#10;liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent&#10;poison in existence.&#10;&#10;Five drops of this he now added to Peter’s cup. His hand shook, but it&#10;was in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided&#10;glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely&#10;to avoid spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim,&#10;and turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged&#10;at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole.&#10;Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around&#10;him, holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the&#10;night, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to&#10;himself, stole away through the trees.&#10;&#10;Peter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement&#10;in darkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten&#10;o’clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened&#10;by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his&#10;tree.&#10;&#10;Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt&#10;for his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.&#10;&#10;“Who is that?”&#10;&#10;For long there was no answer: then again the knock.&#10;&#10;“Who are you?”&#10;&#10;No answer.&#10;&#10;He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached&#10;the door. Unlike Slightly’s door, it filled the aperture, so that he&#10;could not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.&#10;&#10;“I won’t open unless you speak,” Peter cried.&#10;&#10;Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.&#10;&#10;“Let me in, Peter.”&#10;&#10;It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her&#10;face flushed and her dress stained with mud.&#10;&#10;“What is it?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, you could never guess!” she cried, and offered him three guesses.&#10;“Out with it!” he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long&#10;as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she told of the&#10;capture of Wendy and the boys.&#10;&#10;Peter’s heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on&#10;the pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!&#10;&#10;“I’ll rescue her!” he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he&#10;thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his&#10;medicine.&#10;&#10;His hand closed on the fatal draught.&#10;&#10;“No!” shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as&#10;he sped through the forest.&#10;&#10;“Why not?”&#10;&#10;“It is poisoned.”&#10;&#10;“Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?”&#10;&#10;“Hook.”&#10;&#10;“Don’t be silly. How could Hook have got down here?”&#10;&#10;Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the&#10;dark secret of Slightly’s tree. Nevertheless Hook’s words had left no&#10;room for doubt. The cup was poisoned.&#10;&#10;“Besides,” said Peter, quite believing himself, “I never fell asleep.”&#10;&#10;He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one&#10;of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught,&#10;and drained it to the dregs.&#10;&#10;“Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?”&#10;&#10;But she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.&#10;&#10;“What is the matter with you?” cried Peter, suddenly afraid.&#10;&#10;“It was poisoned, Peter,” she told him softly; “and now I am going to&#10;be dead.”&#10;&#10;“O Tink, did you drink it to save me?”&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;“But why, Tink?”&#10;&#10;Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on&#10;his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear&#10;“You silly ass,” and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the&#10;bed.&#10;&#10;His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt&#10;near her in distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and&#10;he knew that if it went out she would be no more. She liked his tears&#10;so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it.&#10;&#10;Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said.&#10;Then he made it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well&#10;again if children believed in fairies.&#10;&#10;Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was&#10;night time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the&#10;Neverland, and who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys&#10;and girls in their nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung&#10;from trees.&#10;&#10;“Do you believe?” he cried.&#10;&#10;Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.&#10;&#10;She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she&#10;wasn’t sure.&#10;&#10;“What do you think?” she asked Peter.&#10;&#10;“If you believe,” he shouted to them, “clap your hands; don’t let Tink&#10;die.”&#10;&#10;Many clapped.&#10;&#10;Some didn’t.&#10;&#10;A few beasts hissed.&#10;&#10;The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to&#10;their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink&#10;was saved. First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed,&#10;then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than&#10;ever. She never thought of thanking those who believed, but she would&#10;have liked to get at the ones who had hissed.&#10;&#10;“And now to rescue Wendy!”&#10;&#10;The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree,&#10;begirt with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his&#10;perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen. He had&#10;hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted&#10;should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low&#10;would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing&#10;birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.&#10;&#10;He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange&#10;names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.&#10;&#10;There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at&#10;which happily he was an adept. But in what direction, for he could not&#10;be sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of&#10;snow had obliterated all footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the&#10;island, as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of the recent&#10;carnage. He had taught the children something of the forest lore that&#10;he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell, and knew that&#10;in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it. Slightly, if he&#10;had an opportunity, would blaze the trees, for instance, Curly would&#10;drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important&#10;place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he could&#10;not wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.&#10;&#10;The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound,&#10;not a movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the&#10;next tree, or stalking him from behind.&#10;&#10;He swore this terrible oath: “Hook or me this time.”&#10;&#10;Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across&#10;a space on which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his&#10;dagger at the ready. He was frightfully happy.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter XIV.&#10;THE PIRATE SHIP&#10;&#10;&#10;One green light squinting over Kidd’s Creek, which is near the mouth of&#10;the pirate river, marked where the brig, the _Jolly Roger_, lay, low in&#10;the water; a rakish-looking craft foul to the hull, every beam in her&#10;detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers. She was the&#10;cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she&#10;floated immune in the horror of her name.&#10;&#10;She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from&#10;her could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none&#10;agreeable save the whir of the ship’s sewing machine at which Smee sat,&#10;ever industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic&#10;Smee. I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were&#10;because he was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had&#10;to turn hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer&#10;evenings he had touched the fount of Hook’s tears and made it flow. Of&#10;this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious.&#10;&#10;A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma of&#10;the night; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and&#10;the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the&#10;deck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or&#10;that out of Hook’s reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in&#10;passing.&#10;&#10;Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of&#10;triumph. Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the&#10;other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. It was his&#10;grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and&#10;knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised&#10;had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his&#10;success?&#10;&#10;But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action&#10;of his sombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.&#10;&#10;He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the&#10;quietude of the night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This&#10;inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs.&#10;They were socially inferior to him.&#10;&#10;Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at&#10;this date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the&#10;lines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school;&#10;and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed&#10;they are largely concerned. Thus it was offensive to him even now to&#10;board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled her, and he still&#10;adhered in his walk to the school’s distinguished slouch. But above all&#10;he retained the passion for good form.&#10;&#10;Good form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that&#10;this is all that really matters.&#10;&#10;From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and&#10;through them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when&#10;one cannot sleep. “Have you been good form to-day?” was their eternal&#10;question.&#10;&#10;“Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,” he cried.&#10;&#10;“Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?” the tap-tap&#10;from his school replied.&#10;&#10;“I am the only man whom Barbecue feared,” he urged, “and Flint feared&#10;Barbecue.”&#10;&#10;“Barbecue, Flint—what house?” came the cutting retort.&#10;&#10;Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about&#10;good form?&#10;&#10;His vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him&#10;sharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped&#10;down his tallow countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he drew&#10;his sleeve across his face, but there was no damming that trickle.&#10;&#10;Ah, envy not Hook.&#10;&#10;There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution. It was as if&#10;Peter’s terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy desire&#10;to make his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for&#10;it.&#10;&#10;“Better for Hook,” he cried, “if he had had less ambition!” It was in&#10;his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person.&#10;&#10;“No little children to love me!”&#10;&#10;Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him&#10;before; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he&#10;muttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under&#10;the conviction that all children feared him.&#10;&#10;Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that&#10;night who did not already love him. He had said horrid things to them&#10;and hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could not hit with&#10;his fist, but they had only clung to him the more. Michael had tried on&#10;his spectacles.&#10;&#10;To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it,&#10;but it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his&#10;mind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the&#10;sleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it that made&#10;him so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself—“Good form?”&#10;&#10;Had the bo’sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of&#10;all?&#10;&#10;He remembered that you have to prove you don’t know you have it before&#10;you are eligible for Pop.&#10;&#10;With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee’s head; but he did&#10;not tear. What arrested him was this reflection:&#10;&#10;“To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?”&#10;&#10;“Bad form!”&#10;&#10;The unhappy Hook was as impotent as he was damp, and he fell forward&#10;like a cut flower.&#10;&#10;His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly&#10;relaxed; and they broke into a bacchanalian dance, which brought him to&#10;his feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of&#10;water had passed over him.&#10;&#10;“Quiet, you scugs,” he cried, “or I’ll cast anchor in you;” and at once&#10;the din was hushed. “Are all the children chained, so that they cannot&#10;fly away?”&#10;&#10;“Ay, ay.”&#10;&#10;“Then hoist them up.”&#10;&#10;The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy,&#10;and ranged in line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious of&#10;their presence. He lolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously,&#10;snatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon&#10;the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face.&#10;&#10;“Now then, bullies,” he said briskly, “six of you walk the plank&#10;to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to&#10;be?”&#10;&#10;“Don’t irritate him unnecessarily,” had been Wendy’s instructions in&#10;the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated the idea&#10;of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would be&#10;prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a&#10;somewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be&#10;the buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for&#10;it, but make constant use of it.&#10;&#10;So Tootles explained prudently, “You see, sir, I don’t think my mother&#10;would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a&#10;pirate, Slightly?”&#10;&#10;He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, “I don’t think so,” as if&#10;he wished things had been otherwise. “Would your mother like you to be&#10;a pirate, Twin?”&#10;&#10;“I don’t think so,” said the first twin, as clever as the others.&#10;“Nibs, would—”&#10;&#10;“Stow this gab,” roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back.&#10;“You, boy,” he said, addressing John, “you look as if you had a little&#10;pluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?”&#10;&#10;Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and&#10;he was struck by Hook’s picking him out.&#10;&#10;“I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,” he said&#10;diffidently.&#10;&#10;“And a good name too. We’ll call you that here, bully, if you join.”&#10;&#10;“What do you think, Michael?” asked John.&#10;&#10;“What would you call me if I join?” Michael demanded.&#10;&#10;“Blackbeard Joe.”&#10;&#10;Michael was naturally impressed. “What do you think, John?” He wanted&#10;John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.&#10;&#10;“Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?” John inquired.&#10;&#10;Through Hook’s teeth came the answer: “You would have to swear, ‘Down&#10;with the King.’”&#10;&#10;Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.&#10;&#10;“Then I refuse,” he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.&#10;&#10;“And I refuse,” cried Michael.&#10;&#10;“Rule Britannia!” squeaked Curly.&#10;&#10;The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,&#10;“That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.”&#10;&#10;They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco&#10;preparing the fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was&#10;brought up.&#10;&#10;No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the&#10;boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all&#10;that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was&#10;not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written&#10;with your finger “Dirty pig”; and she had already written it on&#10;several. But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought, of&#10;course, save for them.&#10;&#10;“So, my beauty,” said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, “you are to see&#10;your children walk the plank.”&#10;&#10;Fine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had&#10;soiled his ruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a&#10;hasty gesture he tried to hide it, but he was too late.&#10;&#10;“Are they to die?” asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful contempt&#10;that he nearly fainted.&#10;&#10;“They are,” he snarled. “Silence all,” he called gloatingly, “for a&#10;mother’s last words to her children.”&#10;&#10;At this moment Wendy was grand. “These are my last words, dear boys,”&#10;she said firmly. “I feel that I have a message to you from your real&#10;mothers, and it is this: ‘We hope our sons will die like English&#10;gentlemen.’”&#10;&#10;Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, “I am&#10;going to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?”&#10;&#10;“What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?”&#10;&#10;“What my mother hopes. John, what are—”&#10;&#10;But Hook had found his voice again.&#10;&#10;“Tie her up!” he shouted.&#10;&#10;It was Smee who tied her to the mast. “See here, honey,” he whispered,&#10;“I’ll save you if you promise to be my mother.”&#10;&#10;But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. “I would almost&#10;rather have no children at all,” she said disdainfully.&#10;&#10;It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to&#10;the mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they&#10;were about to take. They were no longer able to hope that they would&#10;walk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they&#10;could stare and shiver only.&#10;&#10;Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward&#10;Wendy. His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the&#10;boys walking the plank one by one. But he never reached her, he never&#10;heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her. He heard something&#10;else instead.&#10;&#10;It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.&#10;&#10;They all heard it—pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was&#10;blown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded,&#10;but toward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him&#10;alone, and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.&#10;&#10;Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as&#10;if he had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.&#10;&#10;The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly&#10;thought, “The crocodile is about to board the ship!”&#10;&#10;Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no&#10;intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully&#10;alone, any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell:&#10;but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its&#10;guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound&#10;as he could go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and&#10;it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.&#10;&#10;“Hide me!” he cried hoarsely.&#10;&#10;They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was&#10;coming aboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.&#10;&#10;Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of&#10;the boys so that they could rush to the ship’s side to see the&#10;crocodile climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of the&#10;Night of Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid.&#10;It was Peter.&#10;&#10;He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might&#10;rouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter XV.&#10;“HOOK OR ME THIS TIME”&#10;&#10;&#10;Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our&#10;noticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance,&#10;we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don’t&#10;know how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come&#10;that night to Peter. When last we saw him he was stealing across the&#10;island with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had&#10;seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it,&#10;but by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he&#10;thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run&#10;down.&#10;&#10;Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a&#10;fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter&#10;began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use; and&#10;he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the&#10;crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one&#10;unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound,&#10;and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what&#10;it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again&#10;ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a&#10;fixed idea, it was a stupid beast.&#10;&#10;Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs&#10;encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new&#10;element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human&#10;of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: “Hook or me this&#10;time.” He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without&#10;knowing that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for&#10;to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had&#10;not occurred to him.&#10;&#10;On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a&#10;mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with&#10;Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.&#10;&#10;The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the&#10;ticking. At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and&#10;he looked behind him swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it&#10;himself, and in a flash he understood the situation. “How clever of&#10;me!” he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into&#10;applause.&#10;&#10;It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the&#10;forecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by&#10;your watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the&#10;ill-fated pirate’s mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward.&#10;Four boys caught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and&#10;the carrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence.&#10;How long has it taken?&#10;&#10;“One!” (Slightly had begun to count.)&#10;&#10;None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the&#10;cabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look&#10;round. They could hear each other’s distressed breathing now, which&#10;showed them that the more terrible sound had passed.&#10;&#10;“It’s gone, captain,” Smee said, wiping off his spectacles. “All’s&#10;still again.”&#10;&#10;Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently&#10;that he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound,&#10;and he drew himself up firmly to his full height.&#10;&#10;“Then here’s to Johnny Plank!” he cried brazenly, hating the boys more&#10;than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into the&#10;villainous ditty:&#10;&#10;“Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,&#10;    You walks along it so,&#10;Till it goes down and you goes down&#10;    To Davy Jones below!”&#10;&#10;To terrorise the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of&#10;dignity, he danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he&#10;sang; and when he finished he cried, “Do you want a touch of the cat&#10;before you walk the plank?”&#10;&#10;At that they fell on their knees. “No, no!” they cried so piteously&#10;that every pirate smiled.&#10;&#10;“Fetch the cat, Jukes,” said Hook; “it’s in the cabin.”&#10;&#10;The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.&#10;&#10;“Ay, ay,” said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They&#10;followed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed&#10;his song, his dogs joining in with him:&#10;&#10;“Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,&#10;    Its tails are nine, you know,&#10;And when they’re writ upon your back—”&#10;&#10;What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song&#10;was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the&#10;ship, and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well&#10;understood by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than&#10;the screech.&#10;&#10;“What was that?” cried Hook.&#10;&#10;“Two,” said Slightly solemnly.&#10;&#10;The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin.&#10;He tottered out, haggard.&#10;&#10;“What’s the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?” hissed Hook, towering&#10;over him.&#10;&#10;“The matter wi’ him is he’s dead, stabbed,” replied Cecco in a hollow&#10;voice.&#10;&#10;“Bill Jukes dead!” cried the startled pirates.&#10;&#10;“The cabin’s as black as a pit,” Cecco said, almost gibbering, “but&#10;there is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing.”&#10;&#10;The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both&#10;were seen by Hook.&#10;&#10;“Cecco,” he said in his most steely voice, “go back and fetch me out&#10;that doodle-doo.”&#10;&#10;Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying “No,&#10;no”; but Hook was purring to his claw.&#10;&#10;“Did you say you would go, Cecco?” he said musingly.&#10;&#10;Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more&#10;singing, all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a&#10;crow.&#10;&#10;No one spoke except Slightly. “Three,” he said.&#10;&#10;Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture. “’S’death and odds fish,” he&#10;thundered, “who is to bring me that doodle-doo?”&#10;&#10;“Wait till Cecco comes out,” growled Starkey, and the others took up&#10;the cry.&#10;&#10;“I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,” said Hook, purring again.&#10;&#10;“No, by thunder!” Starkey cried.&#10;&#10;“My hook thinks you did,” said Hook, crossing to him. “I wonder if it&#10;would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?”&#10;&#10;“I’ll swing before I go in there,” replied Starkey doggedly, and again&#10;he had the support of the crew.&#10;&#10;“Is this mutiny?” asked Hook more pleasantly than ever. “Starkey’s&#10;ringleader!”&#10;&#10;“Captain, mercy!” Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.&#10;&#10;“Shake hands, Starkey,” said Hook, proffering his claw.&#10;&#10;Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up&#10;Hook advanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing&#10;scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the&#10;sea.&#10;&#10;“Four,” said Slightly.&#10;&#10;“And now,” Hook said courteously, “did any other gentlemen say mutiny?”&#10;Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture, “I’ll&#10;bring out that doodle-doo myself,” he said, and sped into the cabin.&#10;&#10;“Five.” How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be ready,&#10;but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.&#10;&#10;“Something blew out the light,” he said a little unsteadily.&#10;&#10;“Something!” echoed Mullins.&#10;&#10;“What of Cecco?” demanded Noodler.&#10;&#10;“He’s as dead as Jukes,” said Hook shortly.&#10;&#10;His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably,&#10;and the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are&#10;superstitious, and Cookson cried, “They do say the surest sign a ship’s&#10;accurst is when there’s one on board more than can be accounted for.”&#10;&#10;“I’ve heard,” muttered Mullins, “he always boards the pirate craft&#10;last. Had he a tail, captain?”&#10;&#10;“They say,” said another, looking viciously at Hook, “that when he&#10;comes it’s in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.”&#10;&#10;“Had he a hook, captain?” asked Cookson insolently; and one after&#10;another took up the cry, “The ship’s doomed!” At this the children&#10;could not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his&#10;prisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.&#10;&#10;“Lads,” he cried to his crew, “now here’s a notion. Open the cabin door&#10;and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If&#10;they kill him, we’re so much the better; if he kills them, we’re none&#10;the worse.”&#10;&#10;For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his&#10;bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin&#10;and the door was closed on them.&#10;&#10;“Now, listen!” cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to face&#10;the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the&#10;mast. It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it&#10;was for the reappearance of Peter.&#10;&#10;She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which&#10;he had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their&#10;manacles, and now they all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they&#10;could find. First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendy’s bonds, and&#10;then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off&#10;together; but one thing barred the way, an oath, “Hook or me this&#10;time.” So when he had freed Wendy, he whispered for her to conceal&#10;herself with the others, and himself took her place by the mast, her&#10;cloak around him so that he should pass for her. Then he took a great&#10;breath and crowed.&#10;&#10;To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the&#10;cabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but&#10;like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew&#10;that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.&#10;&#10;“Lads,” he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never&#10;quailing for an instant, “I’ve thought it out. There’s a Jonah aboard.”&#10;&#10;“Ay,” they snarled, “a man wi’ a hook.”&#10;&#10;“No, lads, no, it’s the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi’ a&#10;woman on board. We’ll right the ship when she’s gone.”&#10;&#10;Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint’s. “It’s&#10;worth trying,” they said doubtfully.&#10;&#10;“Fling the girl overboard,” cried Hook; and they made a rush at the&#10;figure in the cloak.&#10;&#10;“There’s none can save you now, missy,” Mullins hissed jeeringly.&#10;&#10;“There’s one,” replied the figure.&#10;&#10;“Who’s that?”&#10;&#10;“Peter Pan the avenger!” came the terrible answer; and as he spoke&#10;Peter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who ’twas that had been&#10;undoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he&#10;failed. In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.&#10;&#10;At last he cried, “Cleave him to the brisket!” but without conviction.&#10;&#10;“Down, boys, and at them!” Peter’s voice rang out; and in another&#10;moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the&#10;pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the&#10;onset came when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and&#10;thither, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of&#10;the crew. Man to man they were the stronger; but they fought on the&#10;defensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose&#10;their quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in&#10;dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly, who did not fight,&#10;but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces, so that&#10;they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords&#10;of the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang of&#10;weapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously&#10;counting—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten—eleven.&#10;&#10;I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who&#10;seemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of&#10;fire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a&#10;match for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and&#10;again he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook,&#10;and was using him as a buckler, when another, who had just passed his&#10;sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.&#10;&#10;“Put up your swords, boys,” cried the newcomer, “this man is mine.”&#10;&#10;Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others&#10;drew back and formed a ring around them.&#10;&#10;For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering&#10;slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.&#10;&#10;“So, Pan,” said Hook at last, “this is all your doing.”&#10;&#10;“Ay, James Hook,” came the stern answer, “it is all my doing.”&#10;&#10;“Proud and insolent youth,” said Hook, “prepare to meet thy doom.”&#10;&#10;“Dark and sinister man,” Peter answered, “have at thee.”&#10;&#10;Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage&#10;to either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with&#10;dazzling rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge&#10;that got past his foe’s defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill&#10;stead, and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his&#10;inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced&#10;him back by the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a&#10;favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his&#10;astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he&#10;sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this&#10;time had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging&#10;fiercely, pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose&#10;peculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell&#10;from Hook’s hand, and he was at Peter’s mercy.&#10;&#10;“Now!” cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited&#10;his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a&#10;tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.&#10;&#10;Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker&#10;suspicions assailed him now.&#10;&#10;“Pan, who and what art thou?” he cried huskily.&#10;&#10;“I’m youth, I’m joy,” Peter answered at a venture, “I’m a little bird&#10;that has broken out of the egg.”&#10;&#10;This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook&#10;that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the&#10;very pinnacle of good form.&#10;&#10;“To’t again,” he cried despairingly.&#10;&#10;He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible&#10;sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but&#10;Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of&#10;the danger zone. And again and again he darted in and pricked.&#10;&#10;Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer&#10;asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form&#10;before it was cold forever.&#10;&#10;Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.&#10;&#10;“In two minutes,” he cried, “the ship will be blown to pieces.”&#10;&#10;Now, now, he thought, true form will show.&#10;&#10;But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands,&#10;and calmly flung it overboard.&#10;&#10;What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he&#10;was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he&#10;was true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were flying&#10;around him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck&#10;striking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it&#10;was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up for&#10;good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes were&#10;right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his&#10;socks were right.&#10;&#10;James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.&#10;&#10;For we have come to his last moment.&#10;&#10;Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger&#10;poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He&#10;did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely&#10;stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little&#10;mark of respect from us at the end.&#10;&#10;He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he&#10;stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through&#10;the air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter&#10;kick instead of stab.&#10;&#10;At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.&#10;&#10;“Bad form,” he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.&#10;&#10;Thus perished James Hook.&#10;&#10;“Seventeen,” Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his&#10;figures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two&#10;reached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him&#10;nurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and&#10;Smee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making&#10;a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had&#10;feared.&#10;&#10;Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though&#10;watching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she&#10;became prominent again. She praised them equally, and shuddered&#10;delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one;&#10;and then she took them into Hook’s cabin and pointed to his watch which&#10;was hanging on a nail. It said “half-past one!”&#10;&#10;The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got&#10;them to bed in the pirates’ bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all&#10;but Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell&#10;asleep by the side of Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night,&#10;and cried in his sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him tightly.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter XVI.&#10;THE RETURN HOME&#10;&#10;&#10;By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps; for&#10;there was a big sea running; and Tootles, the bo’sun, was among them,&#10;with a rope’s end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned&#10;pirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up,&#10;with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers.&#10;&#10;It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and&#10;second mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars before the&#10;mast, and lived in the fo’c’sle. Peter had already lashed himself to&#10;the wheel; but he piped all hands and delivered a short address to&#10;them; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties, but&#10;that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they&#10;snapped at him he would tear them. The bluff strident words struck the&#10;note sailors understood, and they cheered him lustily. Then a few sharp&#10;orders were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed her for&#10;the mainland.&#10;&#10;Captain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship’s chart, that if this&#10;weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June,&#10;after which it would save time to fly.&#10;&#10;Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour&#10;of keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they&#10;dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin. Instant&#10;obedience was the only safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking&#10;perplexed when told to take soundings. The general feeling was that&#10;Peter was honest just now to lull Wendy’s suspicions, but that there&#10;might be a change when the new suit was ready, which, against her will,&#10;she was making for him out of some of Hook’s wickedest garments. It was&#10;afterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this&#10;suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook’s cigar-holder in his mouth and&#10;one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger, which he bent and held&#10;threateningly aloft like a hook.&#10;&#10;Instead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that&#10;desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless&#10;flight so long ago. It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this&#10;time; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we&#10;had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, she would&#10;probably have cried, “Don’t be silly; what do I matter? Do go back and&#10;keep an eye on the children.” So long as mothers are like this their&#10;children will take advantage of them; and they may lay to that.&#10;&#10;Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful&#10;occupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance&#10;of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs.&#10;Darling do not go out for the evening. We are no more than servants.&#10;Why on earth should their beds be properly aired, seeing that they left&#10;them in such a thankless hurry? Would it not serve them jolly well&#10;right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the&#10;week-end in the country? It would be the moral lesson they have been in&#10;need of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in this way&#10;Mrs. Darling would never forgive us.&#10;&#10;One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in&#10;the way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed&#10;they will be here on Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the&#10;surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward. They&#10;have been planning it out on the ship: mother’s rapture, father’s shout&#10;of joy, Nana’s leap through the air to embrace them first, when what&#10;they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil&#10;it all by breaking the news in advance; so that when they enter grandly&#10;Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr. Darling may&#10;exclaim pettishly, “Dash it all, here are those boys again.” However,&#10;we should get no thanks even for this. We are beginning to know Mrs.&#10;Darling by this time, and may be sure that she would upbraid us for&#10;depriving the children of their little pleasure.&#10;&#10;“But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by&#10;telling you what’s what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of&#10;delight.”&#10;&#10;“Oh, if you look at it in that way!”&#10;&#10;“What other way is there in which to look at it?”&#10;&#10;You see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say&#10;extraordinarily nice things about her; but I despise her, and not one&#10;of them will I say now. She does not really need to be told to have&#10;things ready, for they are ready. All the beds are aired, and she never&#10;leaves the house, and observe, the window is open. For all the use we&#10;are to her, we might well go back to the ship. However, as we are here&#10;we may as well stay and look on. That is all we are, lookers-on. Nobody&#10;really wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that&#10;some of them will hurt.&#10;&#10;The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine&#10;and six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr.&#10;Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained&#10;Nana up, and that from first to last she had been wiser than he. Of&#10;course, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed he might&#10;have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness&#10;off; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion’s courage to&#10;do what seemed right to him; and having thought the matter out with&#10;anxious care after the flight of the children, he went down on all&#10;fours and crawled into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling’s dear&#10;invitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly:&#10;&#10;“No, my own one, this is the place for me.”&#10;&#10;In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the&#10;kennel until his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but&#10;whatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave&#10;up doing it. And there never was a more humble man than the once proud&#10;George Darling, as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his&#10;wife of their children and all their pretty ways.&#10;&#10;Very touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into&#10;the kennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly.&#10;&#10;Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab,&#10;which conveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way&#10;at six. Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen&#10;if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this&#10;man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he&#10;must have suffered torture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when&#10;the young criticised his little home, and he always lifted his hat&#10;courteously to any lady who looked inside.&#10;&#10;It may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward&#10;meaning of it leaked out, and the great heart of the public was&#10;touched. Crowds followed the cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls&#10;scaled it to get his autograph; interviews appeared in the better class&#10;of papers, and society invited him to dinner and added, “Do come in the&#10;kennel.”&#10;&#10;On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery&#10;awaiting George’s return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look&#10;at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone&#10;now just because she has lost her babes, I find I won’t be able to say&#10;nasty things about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy&#10;children, she couldn’t help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has&#10;fallen asleep. The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is&#10;almost withered up. Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she&#10;had a pain there. Some like Peter best, and some like Wendy best, but I&#10;like her best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her&#10;sleep that the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles&#10;of the window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that&#10;they are on the way. Let’s.&#10;&#10;It is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names;&#10;and there is no one in the room but Nana.&#10;&#10;“O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.”&#10;&#10;Nana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on her&#10;mistress’s lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was&#10;brought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see&#10;that his face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.&#10;&#10;He gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no&#10;imagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of&#10;such a man. Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were&#10;still cheering, and he was naturally not unmoved.&#10;&#10;“Listen to them,” he said; “it is very gratifying.”&#10;&#10;“Lots of little boys,” sneered Liza.&#10;&#10;“There were several adults to-day,” he assured her with a faint flush;&#10;but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.&#10;Social success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some&#10;time he sat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling&#10;of this success, and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she&#10;hoped his head would not be turned by it.&#10;&#10;“But if I had been a weak man,” he said. “Good heavens, if I had been a&#10;weak man!”&#10;&#10;“And, George,” she said timidly, “you are as full of remorse as ever,&#10;aren’t you?”&#10;&#10;“Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a&#10;kennel.”&#10;&#10;“But it is punishment, isn’t it, George? You are sure you are not&#10;enjoying it?”&#10;&#10;“My love!”&#10;&#10;You may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he&#10;curled round in the kennel.&#10;&#10;“Won’t you play me to sleep,” he asked, “on the nursery piano?” and as&#10;she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly, “And shut&#10;that window. I feel a draught.”&#10;&#10;“O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open&#10;for them, always, always.”&#10;&#10;Now it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the&#10;day-nursery and played, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept,&#10;Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room.&#10;&#10;Oh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement&#10;planned by them before we left the ship; but something must have&#10;happened since then, for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter&#10;and Tinker Bell.&#10;&#10;Peter’s first words tell all.&#10;&#10;“Quick Tink,” he whispered, “close the window; bar it! That’s right.&#10;Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will&#10;think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with&#10;me.”&#10;&#10;Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had&#10;exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink&#10;to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head&#10;all the time.&#10;&#10;Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then&#10;he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to&#10;Tink, “It’s Wendy’s mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as&#10;my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my&#10;mother’s was.”&#10;&#10;Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes&#10;bragged about her.&#10;&#10;He did not know the tune, which was “Home, Sweet Home,” but he knew it&#10;was saying, “Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy”; and he cried exultantly,&#10;“You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred!”&#10;&#10;He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw&#10;that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were&#10;sitting on her eyes.&#10;&#10;“She wants me to unbar the window,” thought Peter, “but I won’t, not&#10;I!”&#10;&#10;He peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had&#10;taken their place.&#10;&#10;“She’s awfully fond of Wendy,” he said to himself. He was angry with&#10;her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.&#10;&#10;The reason was so simple: “I’m fond of her too. We can’t both have her,&#10;lady.”&#10;&#10;But the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He&#10;ceased to look at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He&#10;skipped about and made funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as&#10;if she were inside him, knocking.&#10;&#10;“Oh, all right,” he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred the&#10;window. “Come on, Tink,” he cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws&#10;of nature; “we don’t want any silly mothers;” and he flew away.&#10;&#10;Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after&#10;all, which of course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the&#10;floor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already&#10;forgotten his home.&#10;&#10;“John,” he said, looking around him doubtfully, “I think I have been&#10;here before.”&#10;&#10;“Of course you have, you silly. There is your old bed.”&#10;&#10;“So it is,” Michael said, but not with much conviction.&#10;&#10;“I say,” cried John, “the kennel!” and he dashed across to look into&#10;it.&#10;&#10;“Perhaps Nana is inside it,” Wendy said.&#10;&#10;But John whistled. “Hullo,” he said, “there’s a man inside it.”&#10;&#10;“It’s father!” exclaimed Wendy.&#10;&#10;“Let me see father,” Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good look.&#10;“He is not so big as the pirate I killed,” he said with such frank&#10;disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have&#10;been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael&#10;say.&#10;&#10;Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in&#10;the kennel.&#10;&#10;“Surely,” said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory, “he&#10;used not to sleep in the kennel?”&#10;&#10;“John,” Wendy said falteringly, “perhaps we don’t remember the old life&#10;as well as we thought we did.”&#10;&#10;A chill fell upon them; and serve them right.&#10;&#10;“It is very careless of mother,” said that young scoundrel John, “not&#10;to be here when we come back.”&#10;&#10;It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.&#10;&#10;“It’s mother!” cried Wendy, peeping.&#10;&#10;“So it is!” said John.&#10;&#10;“Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?” asked Michael, who was&#10;surely sleepy.&#10;&#10;“Oh dear!” exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse, “it&#10;was quite time we came back.”&#10;&#10;“Let us creep in,” John suggested, “and put our hands over her eyes.”&#10;&#10;But Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently,&#10;had a better plan.&#10;&#10;“Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as&#10;if we had never been away.”&#10;&#10;And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her&#10;husband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited for&#10;her cry of joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not&#10;believe they were there. You see, she saw them in their beds so often&#10;in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around&#10;her still.&#10;&#10;She sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had&#10;nursed them.&#10;&#10;They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three&#10;of them.&#10;&#10;“Mother!” Wendy cried.&#10;&#10;“That’s Wendy,” she said, but still she was sure it was the dream.&#10;&#10;“Mother!”&#10;&#10;“That’s John,” she said.&#10;&#10;“Mother!” cried Michael. He knew her now.&#10;&#10;“That’s Michael,” she said, and she stretched out her arms for the&#10;three little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, they&#10;did, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of&#10;bed and run to her.&#10;&#10;“George, George!” she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling woke&#10;to share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been&#10;a lovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who&#10;was staring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that&#10;other children can never know; but he was looking through the window at&#10;the one joy from which he must be for ever barred.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter XVII.&#10;WHEN WENDY GREW UP&#10;&#10;&#10;I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were&#10;waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they&#10;had counted five hundred they went up. They went up by the stair,&#10;because they thought this would make a better impression. They stood in&#10;a row in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they&#10;were not wearing their pirate clothes. They said nothing, but their&#10;eyes asked her to have them. They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling&#10;also, but they forgot about him.&#10;&#10;Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr.&#10;Darling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a&#10;rather large number.&#10;&#10;“I must say,” he said to Wendy, “that you don’t do things by halves,” a&#10;grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them.&#10;&#10;The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, “Do you think&#10;we should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go&#10;away.”&#10;&#10;“Father!” Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. He knew&#10;he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.&#10;&#10;“We could lie doubled up,” said Nibs.&#10;&#10;“I always cut their hair myself,” said Wendy.&#10;&#10;“George!” Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one showing&#10;himself in such an unfavourable light.&#10;&#10;Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to&#10;have them as she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked&#10;his consent as well as hers, instead of treating him as a cypher in his&#10;own house.&#10;&#10;“I don’t think he is a cypher,” Tootles cried instantly. “Do you think&#10;he is a cypher, Curly?”&#10;&#10;“No, I don’t. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?”&#10;&#10;“Rather not. Twin, what do you think?”&#10;&#10;It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was&#10;absurdly gratified, and said he would find space for them all in the&#10;drawing-room if they fitted in.&#10;&#10;“We’ll fit in, sir,” they assured him.&#10;&#10;“Then follow the leader,” he cried gaily. “Mind you, I am not sure that&#10;we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it’s all the same.&#10;Hoop la!”&#10;&#10;He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried “Hoop la!”&#10;and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget&#10;whether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all&#10;fitted in.&#10;&#10;As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not&#10;exactly come to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so&#10;that she could open it if she liked and call to him. That is what she&#10;did.&#10;&#10;“Hullo, Wendy, good-bye,” he said.&#10;&#10;“Oh dear, are you going away?”&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;“You don’t feel, Peter,” she said falteringly, “that you would like to&#10;say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?”&#10;&#10;“No.”&#10;&#10;“About me, Peter?”&#10;&#10;“No.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp&#10;eye on Wendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys,&#10;and would like to adopt him also.&#10;&#10;“Would you send me to school?” he inquired craftily.&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;“And then to an office?”&#10;&#10;“I suppose so.”&#10;&#10;“Soon I would be a man?”&#10;&#10;“Very soon.”&#10;&#10;“I don’t want to go to school and learn solemn things,” he told her&#10;passionately. “I don’t want to be a man. O Wendy’s mother, if I was to&#10;wake up and feel there was a beard!”&#10;&#10;“Peter,” said Wendy the comforter, “I should love you in a beard;” and&#10;Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.&#10;&#10;“Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.”&#10;&#10;“But where are you going to live?”&#10;&#10;“With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it&#10;high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.”&#10;&#10;“How lovely,” cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her&#10;grip.&#10;&#10;“I thought all the fairies were dead,” Mrs. Darling said.&#10;&#10;“There are always a lot of young ones,” explained Wendy, who was now&#10;quite an authority, “because you see when a new baby laughs for the&#10;first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies&#10;there are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees;&#10;and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue&#10;ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are.”&#10;&#10;“I shall have such fun,” said Peter, with eye on Wendy.&#10;&#10;“It will be rather lonely in the evening,” she said, “sitting by the&#10;fire.”&#10;&#10;“I shall have Tink.”&#10;&#10;“Tink can’t go a twentieth part of the way round,” she reminded him a&#10;little tartly.&#10;&#10;“Sneaky tell-tale!” Tink called out from somewhere round the corner.&#10;&#10;“It doesn’t matter,” Peter said.&#10;&#10;“O Peter, you know it matters.”&#10;&#10;“Well, then, come with me to the little house.”&#10;&#10;“May I, mummy?”&#10;&#10;“Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.”&#10;&#10;“But he does so need a mother.”&#10;&#10;“So do you, my love.”&#10;&#10;“Oh, all right,” Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness&#10;merely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this&#10;handsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his&#10;spring cleaning. Wendy would have preferred a more permanent&#10;arrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming;&#10;but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again. He had no sense of&#10;time, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him&#10;is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because Wendy knew&#10;this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:&#10;&#10;“You won’t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time&#10;comes?”&#10;&#10;Of course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling’s&#10;kiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite&#10;easily. Funny. But she seemed satisfied.&#10;&#10;Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class&#10;III, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V.&#10;Class I is the top class. Before they had attended school a week they&#10;saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island; but it was&#10;too late now, and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or&#10;me or Jenkins minor. It is sad to have to say that the power to fly&#10;gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so&#10;that they should not fly away in the night; and one of their diversions&#10;by day was to pretend to fall off buses; but by and by they ceased to&#10;tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when&#10;they let go of the bus. In time they could not even fly after their&#10;hats. Want of practice, they called it; but what it really meant was&#10;that they no longer believed.&#10;&#10;Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him;&#10;so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first&#10;year. She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves&#10;and berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice&#10;how short it had become; but he never noticed, he had so much to say&#10;about himself.&#10;&#10;She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but&#10;new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.&#10;&#10;“Who is Captain Hook?” he asked with interest when she spoke of the&#10;arch enemy.&#10;&#10;“Don’t you remember,” she asked, amazed, “how you killed him and saved&#10;all our lives?”&#10;&#10;“I forget them after I kill them,” he replied carelessly.&#10;&#10;When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to&#10;see her he said, “Who is Tinker Bell?”&#10;&#10;“O Peter,” she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could not&#10;remember.&#10;&#10;“There are such a lot of them,” he said. “I expect she is no more.”&#10;&#10;I expect he was right, for fairies don’t live long, but they are so&#10;little that a short time seems a good while to them.&#10;&#10;Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to&#10;Peter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was&#10;exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning&#10;in the little house on the tree tops.&#10;&#10;Next year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because&#10;the old one simply would not meet; but he never came.&#10;&#10;“Perhaps he is ill,” Michael said.&#10;&#10;“You know he is never ill.”&#10;&#10;Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, “Perhaps there&#10;is no such person, Wendy!” and then Wendy would have cried if Michael&#10;had not been crying.&#10;&#10;Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he&#10;never knew he had missed a year.&#10;&#10;That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer&#10;she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was&#10;untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years&#10;came and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met&#10;again Wendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her than a&#10;little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown&#10;up. You need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes&#10;to grow up. In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker&#10;than other girls.&#10;&#10;All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely&#10;worth while saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and&#10;Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag&#10;and an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver. Slightly married a lady&#10;of title, and so he became a lord. You see that judge in a wig coming&#10;out at the iron door? That used to be Tootles. The bearded man who&#10;doesn’t know any story to tell his children was once John.&#10;&#10;Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think&#10;that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns.&#10;&#10;Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be&#10;written in ink but in a golden splash.&#10;&#10;She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from&#10;the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions.&#10;When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan.&#10;She loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember&#10;in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It&#10;was Jane’s nursery now, for her father had bought it at the three per&#10;cents from Wendy’s father, who was no longer fond of stairs. Mrs.&#10;Darling was now dead and forgotten.&#10;&#10;There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane’s and her nurse’s;&#10;and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died of old&#10;age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being&#10;very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children&#10;except herself.&#10;&#10;Once a week Jane’s nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy’s&#10;part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was Jane’s&#10;invention to raise the sheet over her mother’s head and her own, thus&#10;making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:&#10;&#10;“What do we see now?”&#10;&#10;“I don’t think I see anything to-night,” says Wendy, with a feeling&#10;that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.&#10;&#10;“Yes, you do,” says Jane, “you see when you were a little girl.”&#10;&#10;“That is a long time ago, sweetheart,” says Wendy. “Ah me, how time&#10;flies!”&#10;&#10;“Does it fly,” asks the artful child, “the way you flew when you were a&#10;little girl?”&#10;&#10;“The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever&#10;did really fly.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, you did.”&#10;&#10;“The dear old days when I could fly!”&#10;&#10;“Why can’t you fly now, mother?”&#10;&#10;“Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the&#10;way.”&#10;&#10;“Why do they forget the way?”&#10;&#10;“Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only&#10;the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.”&#10;&#10;“What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and&#10;innocent and heartless.”&#10;&#10;Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.&#10;&#10;“I do believe,” she says, “that it is this nursery.”&#10;&#10;“I do believe it is,” says Jane. “Go on.”&#10;&#10;They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter&#10;flew in looking for his shadow.&#10;&#10;“The foolish fellow,” says Wendy, “tried to stick it on with soap, and&#10;when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for&#10;him.”&#10;&#10;“You have missed a bit,” interrupts Jane, who now knows the story&#10;better than her mother. “When you saw him sitting on the floor crying,&#10;what did you say?”&#10;&#10;“I sat up in bed and I said, ‘Boy, why are you crying?’”&#10;&#10;“Yes, that was it,” says Jane, with a big breath.&#10;&#10;“And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the&#10;pirates and the redskins and the mermaids’ lagoon, and the home under&#10;the ground, and the little house.”&#10;&#10;“Yes! which did you like best of all?”&#10;&#10;“I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?”&#10;&#10;“The last thing he ever said to me was, ‘Just always be waiting for me,&#10;and then some night you will hear me crowing.’”&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;“But, alas, he forgot all about me,” Wendy said it with a smile. She&#10;was as grown up as that.&#10;&#10;“What did his crow sound like?” Jane asked one evening.&#10;&#10;“It was like this,” Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter’s crow.&#10;&#10;“No, it wasn’t,” Jane said gravely, “it was like this;” and she did it&#10;ever so much better than her mother.&#10;&#10;Wendy was a little startled. “My darling, how can you know?”&#10;&#10;“I often hear it when I am sleeping,” Jane said.&#10;&#10;“Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only&#10;one who heard it awake.”&#10;&#10;“Lucky you,” said Jane.&#10;&#10;And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and&#10;the story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her&#10;bed. Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to&#10;see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she&#10;sat darning she heard a crow. Then the window blew open as of old, and&#10;Peter dropped in on the floor.&#10;&#10;He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still&#10;had all his first teeth.&#10;&#10;He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not&#10;daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.&#10;&#10;“Hullo, Wendy,” he said, not noticing any difference, for he was&#10;thinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might&#10;have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.&#10;&#10;“Hullo, Peter,” she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as&#10;possible. Something inside her was crying “Woman, Woman, let go of me.”&#10;&#10;“Hullo, where is John?” he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.&#10;&#10;“John is not here now,” she gasped.&#10;&#10;“Is Michael asleep?” he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.&#10;&#10;“Yes,” she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as&#10;well as to Peter.&#10;&#10;“That is not Michael,” she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on&#10;her.&#10;&#10;Peter looked. “Hullo, is it a new one?”&#10;&#10;“Yes.”&#10;&#10;“Boy or girl?”&#10;&#10;“Girl.”&#10;&#10;Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.&#10;&#10;“Peter,” she said, faltering, “are you expecting me to fly away with&#10;you?”&#10;&#10;“Of course; that is why I have come.” He added a little sternly, “Have&#10;you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?”&#10;&#10;She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning&#10;times pass.&#10;&#10;“I can’t come,” she said apologetically, “I have forgotten how to fly.”&#10;&#10;“I’ll soon teach you again.”&#10;&#10;“O Peter, don’t waste the fairy dust on me.”&#10;&#10;She had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. “What is it?” he&#10;cried, shrinking.&#10;&#10;“I will turn up the light,” she said, “and then you can see for&#10;yourself.”&#10;&#10;For almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.&#10;“Don’t turn up the light,” he cried.&#10;&#10;She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a&#10;little girl heart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it&#10;all, but they were wet-eyed smiles.&#10;&#10;Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and&#10;when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he&#10;drew back sharply.&#10;&#10;“What is it?” he cried again.&#10;&#10;She had to tell him.&#10;&#10;“I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long&#10;ago.”&#10;&#10;“You promised not to!”&#10;&#10;“I couldn’t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.”&#10;&#10;“No, you’re not.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.”&#10;&#10;“No, she’s not.”&#10;&#10;But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child&#10;with his dagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on&#10;the floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort&#10;him, though she could have done it so easily once. She was only a woman&#10;now, and she ran out of the room to try to think.&#10;&#10;Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed,&#10;and was interested at once.&#10;&#10;“Boy,” she said, “why are you crying?”&#10;&#10;Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.&#10;&#10;“Hullo,” he said.&#10;&#10;“Hullo,” said Jane.&#10;&#10;“My name is Peter Pan,” he told her.&#10;&#10;“Yes, I know.”&#10;&#10;“I came back for my mother,” he explained, “to take her to the&#10;Neverland.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, I know,” Jane said, “I have been waiting for you.”&#10;&#10;When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post&#10;crowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room&#10;in solemn ecstasy.&#10;&#10;“She is my mother,” Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood by&#10;his side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when&#10;they gazed at him.&#10;&#10;“He does so need a mother,” Jane said.&#10;&#10;“Yes, I know,” Wendy admitted rather forlornly; “no one knows it so&#10;well as I.”&#10;&#10;“Good-bye,” said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the&#10;shameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving&#10;about.&#10;&#10;Wendy rushed to the window.&#10;&#10;“No, no,” she cried.&#10;&#10;“It is just for spring cleaning time,” Jane said, “he wants me always&#10;to do his spring cleaning.”&#10;&#10;“If only I could go with you,” Wendy sighed.&#10;&#10;“You see you can’t fly,” said Jane.&#10;&#10;Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse&#10;of her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky&#10;until they were as small as stars.&#10;&#10;As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her&#10;figure little again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a&#10;common grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring&#10;cleaning time, except when he forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and&#10;takes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself,&#10;to which he listens eagerly. When Margaret grows up she will have a&#10;daughter, who is to be Peter’s mother in turn; and thus it will go on,&#10;so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.&#10;&#10;THE END&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PETER PAN ***&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will&#10;be renamed.&#10;&#10;Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright&#10;law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,&#10;so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United&#10;States without permission and without paying copyright&#10;royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of&#10;electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of&#10;computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It&#10;exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations&#10;from people in all walks of life.&#10;&#10;Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the&#10;assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s&#10;goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will&#10;remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project&#10;Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure&#10;and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future&#10;generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary&#10;Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see&#10;Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.&#10;&#10;Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation&#10;&#10;The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit&#10;501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the&#10;state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal&#10;Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification&#10;number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary&#10;Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by&#10;U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.&#10;&#10;The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,&#10;Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up&#10;to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website&#10;and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact&#10;&#10;Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg&#10;Literary Archive Foundation&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread&#10;public support and donations to carry out its mission of&#10;increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be&#10;freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest&#10;array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations&#10;($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt&#10;status with the IRS.&#10;&#10;The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating&#10;charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United&#10;States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a&#10;considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up&#10;with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations&#10;where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND&#10;DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state&#10;visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.&#10;&#10;While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we&#10;have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition&#10;against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who&#10;approach us with offers to donate.&#10;&#10;International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make&#10;any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from&#10;outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.&#10;&#10;Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation&#10;methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other&#10;ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To&#10;donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.&#10;&#10;Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works&#10;&#10;Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project&#10;Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be&#10;freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and&#10;distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of&#10;volunteer support.&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed&#10;editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in&#10;the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not&#10;necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper&#10;edition.&#10;&#10;Most people start at our website which has the main PG search&#10;facility: www.gutenberg.org.&#10;&#10;This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,&#10;including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary&#10;Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to&#10;subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks." />
